					<p>This spell was created by the priests of Helm to aid in guard duty while most
members of a group of travelers in the wild are sleeping. Like the lst-level
wizard spell unseen servant, this spell creates an invisible, mindless, and
shapeless force. This force cannot fight and, unlike an unseen servant, it can-
not affect its physical surrounding except as indicated below.
The priest casts this spell by walking the perimeter of the area of effect
sprinkling pinches of sand every few feet and then returning to the center of
the area of effect. Once the spellcasting is completed, the shadowy sentry
stands guard in the center of the area of effect and the caster immediately
falls asleep.
If any visible object over 1 foot in length, width, or height which was not
present during the casting of the spell enters the area of effect while the spell
is in operation or if the spell is about to end, the shadowy force silently
shakes the caster awake. When the caster awakes, the priest is wide awake
and aware that something has triggered the sentry or that the spell has
ended. The spell then immediately expires.
A visible object must be an object that a guard could have perceived with
normal vision if she or he had been awake and on guard duty. Visible objects
cannot be invisible, hiding in shadows, or hidden behind walls, trees, or earth.
If this spell is cast by a priest of 5th level or higher, the sentry of Helm also
has 60-foot infravision in addition to normal sight, and what is visible to it
 to vgs
includes beings seen with that faculty.
The material component of this spell is the priest's holy symbol and a
small bag of fine sand.

					<p>By casting this spell, the caster confers exceptional powers of
observation and alertness to one creature for the duration of the
spell. While blessed Watchfulness is in effect, the designated
sentinel remains alert, awake, and vigilant for the duration of
the spell. In fact, it takes a roll of 1 to surprise someone under
this effect. Those under the effect of this spell resist sleep spells
and similar magic as if they were 4 levels or Hit Dice higher than
their actual level, and they gain a +2 bonus to saving throws
against other spells or effects that could lower their guards or
force them to abandon their watches, including charm, beguil-
ing, fear, emotion, and similar mind-affecting spells. However, if
the effect normally allows no saving throw, watchers who have
blessed Watchfulness in effect on them gain no special benefit.

				<div id="description-content">
					<p>This spell enables the priest to send an instantaneous mental
missive to his or her comrades alerting them to a dangerous sit-
uation. It is not possible to send any message other than "Alert"
by means of this spell, nor is two-way communication of any
sort possible, but the true meaning of the mental missive, other
than the fact that a dangerous situation exists, can be pre-
arranged if so desired.

Alert allies can only be cast on awake, living, and sentient (ani-
mal [1] intelligence or higher) creatures. The somatic compo-
nent of the spell involves the priest physically touching fore-
heads for one full round with each recipient. One ally, up to a
maximum of 10 such individuals, can be linked by means of this
spell per level of the spellcaster.

Once cast, the mental links forged by means of this spelt last
until the alert is broadcast or for at most 8 hours. An alert has
a maximum range of 30 yards around the priest. Anyone
beyond that range does not hear the alert, although the spell
effect (and the mental link) ends nonetheless. Likewise, anyone
maintaining a psionic defense shield, wearing a ring of mind
shielding, or employing similar magics also does not receive the
mental warning. However, if a recipient is asleep and that con-
dition is not maintained by chemical or magical means
(although it may have been induced by such), she or he imme-
diately awakens and is aware that an alert has been issued.

It is possible to issue a mental missive and then perform anoth-
er action aside from casting a spell in the same round. The alert
broadcast effectively imposes an initiative penalty of 1 on any
other course of action attempted in the same round.

					<p>This spell allows the caster to ignore hunger, thirst, and
extremes of climate for an extended period of time. While the
spell is in effect, the priest requires no food or drink. She or he
is effectively immune to exposure, dehydration, and heat or
cold injury, since no naturally occurring climatic condition can
cause him or her harm. (Lightning, floods, tornadoes, earth-
quakes, and other such hazardous phenomena can still cause
physical injury, of course.)

Iron vigil allows the caster to ignore the need to sleep by choos-
ing to mediate instead. While meditating, the caster can keep
watch on his or her surroundings but suffers a +1 penalty to
any surprise checks. If the character wishes to memorize spells,
she or he must sleep normally.

At the spell's end, the priest must eat and drink; if no food or
water is available, the character must make a Constitution
check once every 4 hours with a cumulative -1 penalty or fall
into a coma and perish within 1d3 days 'lie or he receives no
aid. The caster also requires at least 4 hours of rest for each day
that she or he did not eat, drink, or sleep during the vigil.

					<p>   The spike stones spell causes rock to shape itself into long, sharp points that tend to
blend into the background. It is effective on both natural rock and worked stone. The
spike stones serve to impede progress through an area and to inflict damage. If an area is
carefully observed, each observer is 25% likely to notice the sharp points of rock.
Otherwise, those entering the spell's area of effect suffer 1d4 points of damage per round.
The success of each attack is determined as if the caster of the spell were actually
engaging in combat. Those entering the area are subject to attack immediately upon
setting foot in the area and for each round spent in the area thereafter. The initial step
enables the individual to become aware of some problem only if the initial attack
succeeds; otherwise movement continues and the spike stones remain unnoticed until
damage occurs. Charging or running victims suffer two attacks per round.

   Those falling into pits affected by spike stones suffer six such attacks for every 10 feet
fallen, each attack having a +2 bonus to the attack roll. In addition, the damage inflicted
by each attack increases by +2 for every 10 feet fallen. Finally, the creatures also suffer
normal falling damage.

   The material component of this spell is four tiny stalactites.

					<p>   When this spell is cast, an invisible barrier comes into being in front of the wizard.
This shield totally negates magic missile attacks. It provides the equivalent protection of
AC 2 against hand-hurled missiles (axes, darts, javelins, spears, etc.), AC 3 against small
device-propelled missiles (arrows, bolts, bullets, manticore spikes, sling stones, etc.), and
AC 4 against all other forms of attack. The shield also adds a +1 bonus to the wizard's
saving throws against attacks that are basically frontal. Note that these benefits apply
only if the attacks originate from in front of the wizard, where the shield can move to
interpose itself.

					<p>This spell causes the priest's eyes to emit twin rays of fire. These
thin, ruby-red beams are hot enough to burn holes in plate
armour in 1 round and in most stone walls in 2 rounds. The eye
beams cause 2d8 points of damage per round to any creature
they touch except the caster (including items worn or carried).
Creatures struck who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell sus-
tain only half damage.

The caster can train his or her eye beams on a maximum of two
creatures per round, attacking with the priest's normal THAC0.
Beings struck by one beam in a round take the above damage.
Beings struck by two beams in the same round take the above
damage twice unless they are wearing armor, in which case
they take the same damage as being struck by one beam and
their armor must succeed at a saving throw vs. lightning or be
destroyed. Magical items gain saving throw bonuses equal to
any magical "plus" bonuses they possess. If the priest desires,
she or he can forgo attacking a person and try to strike a par-
ticular item, attacking with the priest's normal THAC0 if two
strikes are made or with a -4 penalty for a called shot if only one
attack is made. Items other than magical armor must succeed
at item saving throws vs. magical fire if they are struck or be
destroyed. (Magical items, including magical armor, gain saving
throw bonuses equal to any magical "plus" bonuses they pos-
sess. Artifacts and relics are not affected by this spell.) If the
priest focuses on a stationary object (such as a wall), striking it
is automatic, and the DM must adjudicate what degree of struc-
tural damage occurs within the amount of time the priest focus-
es the eye beams on the stationary object.

While the caster's eyes are emitting fire, she or he can see nor-
mally but cannot cast or wield any other magic. The caster can
end the spell at will before it would expire normally. Emitting the
beams can also be interrupted temporarily so that the priest can
look at creatures and things without burning them. The spell
does not stop the priest from engaging in physical activities
(including combat) while it is active.

The caster is immune to the direct effects of his or her eye
beams (or their reflection), but not to the effects of any fires
they might start. Creatures immune to flame damage are
unharmed by fire eyes.

The material component is the priest's holy symbol.

					<p>By means of this spell, the caster is able to show any animal of animal intelligence to
semi-intelligence (i.e., Intelligence 1-4) that he desires friendship. If the animal does not
roll a successful saving throw vs. spell immediately when the spell is begun, it stands
quietly while the caster finishes the spell. Thereafter, it follows the caster about. The spel
functions only if the caster actually wishes to be the animal's friend. If the caster has
ulterior motives, the animal always senses them (for example, the caster intends to eat the
animal, send it ahead to set off traps, etc.).

   The caster can teach the befriended animal three specific tricks or tasks for each point
of Intelligence it possesses. Typical tasks are those taught to a dog or similar pet (i.e.,
they cannot be complex). Training for each such trick must be done over a period of one
week, and all must be done within three months of acquiring the creature. During the
three-month period, the animal will not harm the caster, but if the creature is left alone fo
more than a week, it will revert to its natural state and act accordingly.

   The caster can use this spell to attract up to 2 Hit Dice of animal(s) per experience
level he possesses. This is also the maximum total Hit Dice of the animals that can be
attracted and trained at one time: no more than twice the caster's experience level. Only
unaligned animals can be attracted, befriended, and trained.

					<p>Upon uttering the bless spell, the caster raises the morale of friendly creatures and any
saving throw rolls they make against fear effects by +1. Furthermore, it raises their attack
dice rolls by +1. A blessing, however, affects only those not already engaged in melee
combat. The caster determines at what range (up to 60 yards) he will cast the spell. At the
instant the spell is completed, it affects all creatures in a 50-foot cube centered on the
point selected by the caster (thus, affected creatures leaving the area are still subject to
the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not).

   A second use of this spell is to bless a single item (for example, a crossbow bolt for use
against a rakshasa). The weight of the item is limited to one pound per caster level and
the effect lasts until the item is used or the spell duration ends.

   Multiple bless spells are not cumulative. In addition to the verbal and somatic gesture
components, the bless spell requires holy water.

					<p>Using this spell, three to five priests combine their abilities so that one of them casts
spells and turns undead at an enhanced level. The highest-level priest (or one of them, if
two or more are tied for highest) stands alone, while the others join hands in a
surrounding circle. The central priest casts the combine spell. He temporarily gains one
level for each priest in the circle, up to a maximum gain of four levels. The level increase
affects turning undead and spell details that vary with the caster's level. Note that the
central priest gains no additional spells and that the group is limited to his currently
memorized spells.

   The encircling priests must concentrate on maintaining the combine effect. They lose
all Armor Class bonuses for shield and Dexterity. If any of them has his concentration
broken, the combine spell ends immediately. If the combine spell is broken while the
central priest is in the act of casting a spell, that spell is ruined just as if the caster were
disturbed. Spells cast in combination have the full enhanced effect, even if the combine is
broken before the duration of the enhanced spell ends. Note that the combination is not
broken if only the central caster is disturbed.

					<p>This spell enables the priest to command another creature with a single word. The
command must be uttered in a language understood by the creature. The subject will obey
to the best of his/its ability only as long as the command is absolutely clear and
unequivocal; thus, a command of "Suicide!" is ignored. A command to "Die!" causes the
creature to fall in a faint or cataleptic state for one round, but thereafter the creature
revives and is alive and well. Typical commands are back, halt, flee, run, stop, fall, go,
leave, surrender, sleep, rest, etc. No command affects a creature for more than one round;
undead are not affected at all. Creatures with Intelligence of 13 (high) or more, or those
with 6 or more Hit Dice (or experience levels) are entitled to a saving throw vs. spell,
adjusted for Wisdom. (Creatures with 13 or higher Intelligence and 6 Hit Dice/levels get
only one saving throw!)

					<p>   This spell discovers emanations of evil from
any creature, object, or area. Character alignment, however, is revealed only under
unusual circumstances: characters who are strongly aligned, who do not stray from their
faith, and who are of at least 9th level might radiate good or evil if intent upon
appropriate actions. Powerful monsters, such as rakshasas send forth
emanations of evil, even if polymorphed. Aligned undead radiate evil, for it is
this power and negative force that enable them to continue existing. An evilly cursed
object or unholy water radiates evil, but a hidden trap or an unintelligent viper does not.

   The degree of evil (dim, faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming) and possibly its
general nature (expectant, malignant, gloating, etc.) can be noted. If the evil is
overwhelming, the priest has a 10% chance per level of detecting its general bent (lawful,
neutral, or chaotic). The duration of a detect evil spell is one turn plus
five rounds per level of the priest. Thus, a 1st-level priest can cast a spell with a 15-round
duration, a 2nd-level priest can cast a spell with a 20-round duration, etc. The spell has a
path of detection 10 feet wide in the direction the priest is facing. The priest must
concentrate--stop, have quiet, and intently seek to detect the aura--for at least one round
to receive a reading.

   The spell requires the use of the priest's holy symbol as its material component, with
the priest holding it before him.

					<p>   When the detect magic spell is cast, the priest detects magical radiations in a path 10
feet wide and up to 30 yards long, in the direction he is facing. The intensity of the magic
can be detected (dim, faint, moderate, strong, or overwhelming). The caster has a 10%
chance per level to determine the sphere of the magic, but unlike the wizard version of
the spell, the type of magic (alteration, conjuration, etc.) cannot be divined. The caster

					<p>   Upon casting this spell, the caster is able to detect snares, pits, deadfalls and similar
hazards along a path 10 feet wide and 40 feet long. Such hazards include simple pits,
deadfalls, snares of wilderness creatures (for example, trapdoor spiders, giant sundews,
ant lions, etc.), and primitive traps constructed of natural materials (mantraps, missile
trips, hunting snares, etc.). The spell is directional--the caster must face the desired
direction to determine if a pit exists or a trap is laid in that direction. The caster
experiences a feeling of danger from the direction of a detected hazard, which increases
as the danger is approached. The caster learns the general nature of the danger (pit, snare,
or deadfall) but not its exact operation, nor how to disarm it. Close examination,
however, enables the caster to sense what intended actions might trigger it. The spell
detects certain natural hazards--quicksand (snare), sinkholes (pit), or unsafe walls of
natural rock (deadfall). Other hazards, such as a cavern that floods during rain, an unsafe
construction, or a naturally poisonous plant, are not revealed. The spell does not detect
magical traps (save those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the 2nd-level spell
trip and the 3rd-level spell snare), nor those that are mechanically complex, nor those
that have been rendered safe or inactive.

   The caster must have his holy symbol to complete the spell.

(depending on which application the priest selects at the time of casting). The creature
can stand unprotected in temperatures as low as -30 F. or as high as 130 F. (depending
on application) with no ill effect. Temperatures beyond these limits inflict 1 point of
damage per hour of exposure for every degree beyond the limit. The spell is immediately
cancelled if the recipient is affected by any non-normal heat or cold, such as magic,
breath weapons, and so on. The cancellation occurs regardless of the application and
regardless of whether a heat or cold effect hits the character (for example, an endure cold
spell is cancelled by magical heat or fire as well as by magical cold). The recipient of the
spell does not suffer the first 10 points of damage (after any applicable saving throws)
from the heat or cold during the round in which the spell is broken. The spell ends
instantly if either resist fire or resist cold is cast upon the recipient.

or chant does not end the ward.

   The material component is the priest's holy symbol.

					<p>   This spell causes a luminous glow within 20 feet of the spell's center. The area of light
thus caused is equal in brightness to torchlight. Objects in darkness beyond this sphere
can be seen, at best, as vague and shadowy shapes. The spell is centered on a point
selected by the caster, and he must have a line of sight or unobstructed path to that point
when the spell is cast. Light can spring from air, rock, metal, wood, or almost any similar
substance. The effect is immobile unless it is specifically centered on a movable object or
mobile creature. If this spell is cast upon a creature, any applicable magic resistance and
saving throws must be rolled. Successful resistance negates the spell, while a successful
saving throw indicates that the spell is centered immediately behind the creature, rather
than upon the creature itself. A light spell centered on the visual organs of a creature
blinds it, reducing its attack and saving throw rolls by 4 and worsening its Armor Class
by 4. The caster can extinguish the light at any time by uttering a single word. Light
spells are not cumulative--multiple castings do not provide a brighter light.

A darkness spell cast directly against a light spell cancels both, and vice versa.

					<p>   The caster can find the direction and distance of any one type of animal or plant he
desires. The caster, facing in a direction, thinks of the animal or plant, and then knows if
any such animal or plant is within range. If so, the exact distance and approximate
number present is learned. During each round of the spell's duration, the caster can face
in only one direction (i.e., only a 20-foot-wide path can be known). The spell lasts one
round per level of experience of the caster, while the length of the path is 100 yards plus
20 yards per level of experience. (At the DM's option, some casters may be able to locate
only those animals [or plants] associated closely with their own mythos.)

   While the exact chance of locating a specific type of animal or plant depends on the
details and circumstances of the locale, the general frequency of the subject can be used
as a guideline: common = 50%, uncommon = 30%, rare = 15%, and very rare = 5%. Most
herbs grow in temperate regions, while most spices grow in tropical regions. Most plants
sought as spell components or for magical research are rare or very rare. The results of
this spell are always determined by the DM.

   The material component is the caster's holy symbol.

					<p>   By using this spell, the priest can temporarily enchant up to three small pebbles, no
larger than sling bullets. The magical stones can then be hurled or slung at an opponent.
If hurled, they can be thrown up to 30 yards, and all three can be thrown in one round.
The character using them must roll normally to hit, although the magic of the stones
enables any character to be proficient with them. The stones are considered +1 weapons
for determining if a creature can be struck (those struck only by magical weapons, for
instance), although they do not have an attack or damage bonus. Each stone that hits
inflicts 1d4 points of damage (2d4 points against undead). The magic in each stone lasts
only for half an hour, or until used.

   The material components are the priest's holy symbol and three small pebbles,
unworked by tools or magic of any type.

					<p>When this spell is cast, it creates a magical barrier around the recipient at a distance of
1 foot. The barrier moves with the recipient and has three major effects:
   First, all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures against the protected

creature receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll, and any saving throws caused by such
attacks are made by the protected creature with a +2 bonus.

   Second, any attempt to exercise mental control over the protected creature (if, for
example, it has been charmed by a vampire) or to invade and take over its mind (as by a
ghost's magic jar attack) is blocked by this spell. Note that the protection does not prevent
a vampire's charm itself, nor end it, but it does prevent the vampire from exercising
mental control through the barrier. Likewise, an outside life force is merely kept out, and
would not be expelled if in place before the protection was cast.

   Third, the spell prevents bodily contact by creatures of an extraplanar or conjured
nature (such as aerial servants, elementals, imps, invisible stalkers, salamanders, water
weirds, xorn, and others). This causes the natural (body) weapon attacks of such creatures
to fail and the creature to recoil if such attacks require touching the protected creature.
Animals or monsters summoned or conjured by spells or similar magic are likewise
hedged from the character. This protection ends if the protected character makes a melee
attack against or tries to force the barrier against the blocked creature.

   To complete this spell, the priest uses holy water or burning incense.
   This spell can be reversed to become protection from good, with the second and third
benefits remaining unchanged.
   The material components for the reverse are a circle of unholy water or smoldering
dung.

					<p>   The priest casting this spell instills courage in the spell recipient, raising the creature's
saving throw rolls against magical fear attacks by +4 for one turn. If the recipient has
recently (that day) failed a saving throw against such an attack, the spell immediately
grants another saving throw, with a +4 bonus to the die roll. For every four levels of the
caster, one creature can be affected by the spell (one creature at levels 1 through 4, two
creatures at levels 5 through 8, etc.).

the reversed effect negates it, and any Wisdom adjustment also applies. Of course, cause
fear can be automatically countered by remove fear and vice versa.

					<p>   When the priest casts a sanctuary spell, any opponent attempting to strike or otherwise
directly attack the protected creature must roll a saving throw vs. spell. If the saving
throw is successful, the opponent can attack normally and is unaffected by that casting of
the spell. If the saving throw is failed, the opponent loses track of and totally ignores the
warded creature for the duration of the spell. Those not attempting to attack the subject
remain unaffected. Note that this spell does not prevent the operation of area attacks
(fireball, ice storm, etc.). While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct
offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use nonattack spells or otherwise act
in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a
warded priest to heal wounds, for example, or to bless, perform an augury, chant, cast a
light in the area (but not upon an opponent), and so on.

   The components of the spell include the priest's holy symbol and a small silver mirror.

					<p>    This spell allows a priest to sense how far a character, creature, object, or area is from
a condition of balance -- in other words, the degree to which its alignment is removed
from true Neutral. The spell gives no indication of the "direction" in which the alignment
is removed from true Neutral except under certain conditions which follow. The spell
does, however, indicate along which axis or axes of alignment the variation lies.

    For example, a priest uses this spell to analyze the balance of a Chaotic Neutral
creature. The spell indicates that the creature is removed from Neutral by one grade, and
the variation is along the Law/Chaos axis; thus, the creature must be either Chaotic
Neutral or Lawful Neutral. If the creature were Chaotic Evil, the spell would indicate that
it is removed from balance by two grades, one along each axis; thus, the creature must be
Chaotic Evil, Chaotic Good, Lawful Evil, or Lawful Good.

    A priest has a 5% chance per level of correctly determining the direction of variation
along one randomly chosen axis. This means that a 10th-level priest evaluating the
balance of a Chaotic Neutral creature would have a 50% chance of learning that the
creature is Chaotic (and hence Chaotic Neutral, since it is only one step away from
balance).

    Similar to spells such as detect evil, this spell will not yield a result on a hidden trap.
If cast on a creature with an intelligence level of "animal" or "non-," it will always read
true Neutral (i.e., zero steps removed from balance).

    The material components are four iron coins which the priest tosses in his hand while
concentrating on the spell. The coins are not consumed in the casting.

performance. If the priest has been true to his faith (as determined by the DM), the priest
gains a +3 (or +15%) bonus to one die roll (his choice) needed to complete the task. The
bonus may be used to affect a saving throw, attack roll, ability check, etc. For example, if
a priest were about to cross a narrow log high above a chasm, he could cast this spell and
gain a +3 bonus to his Dexterity ability check.

					<p>    This spell imbues the target unit with a temporary burst of courage. To cast this spell,
the priest must have an uninterrupted line of sight to the target unit.

    A courage spell enables a unit to automatically pass its first morale check following
the casting of this spell. When circumstances arise that would necessitate a morale check,
no die roll is made and the unit is assumed to have passed the check. After this occurs,
the spell ends and the unit must make all future morale checks normally.

    If a unit under the influence of a courage spell is not forced to make any morale
checks, the spell expires at the first sunset.

    When several different events simultaneously trigger morale checks, the
BATTLESYSTEMTM rules apply penalties to a single morale check. If this occurs to a
unit under the influence of a courage spell, the player commanding the unit selects one
such event and its modifier is ignored.

    No more than one courage spell can affect a unit at one time. Once the spell has
expired, a priest can cast the spell again on the same unit.

    The material component is a cube of cast iron.

					<p>    This spell can be used in two distinct ways. The first is appropriate for battlefield use.
The priest can cast this spell on any unit within 240 yards in an uninterrupted line of
sight. The casting time for this use is one turn and the material component is a gem of at
least 100 gp value which is consumed during the casting.

    At the conclusion of this use of the spell, the target unit's morale is modified by 1,
either positively or negatively, as the caster desires. This modification remains in effect
for 1d4+2 turns.

    The second and more powerful use of the spell requires lengthy preparations. Casting
must take place inside or within 100 yards of a place of worship dedicated to the casting
priest's deity. Both the priest and the unit to be affected must be present. The casting time
for this use is 5 turns. The material component is the priest's holy symbol.

    At the conclusion of this use of the spell, the unit's morale is raised by 3 (maximum
of 19). This morale increase lasts until the next sunset. Only priests of 10th level or
higher can cast this version of the spell.

					<p>    This is a cooperative magic spell. It requires a minimum of two priests and can
accommodate a maximum of ten. Each priest must cast ring of hands on the same round.
At the end of the casting, the priests involved join hands, thus completing the spell. If any
priest breaks the circle, the spell immediately ceases. The priests may not move from
their locations but are free to speak. They may not cast spells requiring a somatic or
material component while the ring is formed.

    The ring of hands forms a protective barrier around the priests and everything within
their circle. For each priest, assume a five-foot circumference of the circle; thus, three
priests would create a circle of 15-foot circumference. For easy calculation, assume that
for each priest, the circle can accommodate four persons.

    The barrier functions as a protection from evil spell. Attacks by evil creatures suffer a
-1 penalty for every priest forming the circle. Saving throws made by the priests or
anyone in the circle against attacks from such creatures receive a +1 bonus for every
priest in the circle.

    Attempts at mental control over protected creatures are blocked. Extraplanar and
conjured creatures are unable to touch the priests and those within the circle, although
melee attacks against such creatures by those within the ring break the barrier.

    Because the priests casting the spell cannot move and must hold hands, they do not
receive any Dexterity bonuses to Armor Class. Furthermore, opponents gain a +2 bonus
on attack rolls against the priests, since there is little they can do to avoid a blow.
Creatures within the ring are free to act as they wish. Melee attacks by those within the
ring are limited to piercing weapons and suffer a -1 penalty to attack rolls since the
priests intervene.

    The reverse of this spell, ring of woe, functions as detailed above except the effect
applies to good creatures as would a protection from good spell.

					<p>         This spell soothes and quiets normal animals, which renders them docile and
harmless. Only creatures with Intelligence ratings of 1 to 4 (in other words, animal- or
semi-intelligent creatures) can be affected by this spell. The caster can calm 2d4 Hit Dice
of animals, plus 1 Hit Die per level, so a 4th-level priest could affect 2d4+4 Hit Dice of
creatures. The caster can affect any animals he wishes to within the spell's range, but all
the subjects must be of the same species. The subject creatures are not allowed a saving
throw unless they have magical powers, abilities, or are clearly not entirely natural; a
priest could calm a normal bear, war dog, or wolf with little trouble, but it's more
difficult to affect a winter wolf, hell hound, or owlbear.

         While under the influence of this spell, the affected creatures remain where they
are and do not attack or flee, unless they are attacked or confronted by a significant
hazard such as a fire or a hungry predator. Once roused, the spell's magic is broken and
the animals are free to act in whatever fashion they normally would. Note that creatures
affected by this spell are not helpless and defend themselves normally if attacked.

					<p>         This spell removes physical fatigue or exhaustion from the subject by undoing the
physiological effects of his exertions. The subject is instantly restored to his normal, fully

Chapter 6. Once this spell has been cast, the subject may start to accumulate fatigue or

				<div id="description-content">
					<p>         The most humble of priestly spells is the orison, a brief prayer or invocation of a
minor nature. Typically, priests learn a number of orisons as acolytes or students in order
to hone their spellcasting skills and emphasize concepts, ideals, or phrases of particular
importance to the faith. Because an orisons is not even on par with other 1st-level magic,
a priest memorizes a number of individual orisons equal to three +1 per level (up to a
maximum of nine) when he devotes a 1st-level spell slot to orison. In other words, a
1st-level priest can memorize four orisons for one 1st-level spell slot, a 2nd-level priest
can memorize five, and so on.

         Unlike cantrip, an orison must have a specific effect, although the priest need not
decide which incantation he will use until he actually casts the spell. Regardless of the
prayer chosen, the orison's duration is never more than one round per level. Known
orisons include the following:

         Alleviate: A single creature suffering from nausea or pain is relieved of its
discomfort. Magically induced nausea or pain is only alleviated if the victim passes a
saving throw vs. spell with a ­2 penalty.

         Calm: A single creature that has been startled or frightened is soothed. Victims
suffering from magical fear may attempt a save vs. spell with a ­2 penalty to calm
themselves.

         Clarity: For the duration of the orison, the priest's speech is clear and free of
impediment--useful for readings from sacred texts and other such rites. Magical
conditions such as confuse languages cannot be overcome by this orison.

         Courage: The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next attack roll, as long as the attack
is made within the spell's duration.

         Guidance: The priest gains a +1 bonus to a Wisdom or Intelligence check to
determine the right course of action in a moral dilemma or puzzle.

         Healing: By his touch, the priest may heal a creature of 1 point of damage.
         Magic sense: If there is a persistent spell effect or magical item within 10 yards,
the priest feels a recognizable tingle or sensation of some kind. He has no way to
determine what item or spell may have caused the reaction.
         Memory: Any item the priest commits to memory during the spell duration is
more completely and permanently learned; he gains a +2 bonus to any checks to recall
the exact appearance, wording, or meaning of an item, text, or message.
         Resistance to magic: The caster gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw
against magic of any type, as long as it occurs during the orison's duration.
         Resistance to poison: The priest gains a +1 bonus to his next saving throw vs.
poison, as long as it occurs during the orison's duration.
         Other orisons of similar power or scope may be permitted by the DM. Generally,
an orison should not affect more than one creature or die roll at a time, and an orison that
can actually cause immediate harm to a creature should inflict no more than 1 or 2 points
of damage. An offensive orison would be quite rare and most probably associated with an
evil or chaotic priesthood.

					<p>         Resembling the spell protection from evil, this abjuration wards the creature
touched from the attacks of minions of chaos. Chaotic creatures suffer a ­2 penalty to
attack rolls against the spell recipient, and the subject gains a +2 bonus to saving throws
against spells or other attacks employed by chaotic creatures. Attempts to possess,
dominate, or exercise other forms of mental control against the recipient are
automatically blocked by this spell.

         Protection from chaos also wards the recipient against contact with extraplanar
creatures of chaotic origin, including tanar'ri, slaad, and eladrin. Unlike protection from
evil, this spell does not necessarily guard against summoned or conjured creatures unless
the creatures in question are chaotic in alignment. However, protection from chaos does
protect the recipient from creatures influenced by confusion and chaos spells and effects.
The natural or bodily attacks of such creatures automatically fail, as long as the recipient
does not use the spell's power to trap, pin, or drive back the chaotic creatures in question.
The spell ends if the recipient makes a melee attack against creatures that are prevented
from attacking him by this spell.

         The material component is a small ring of gold or lead tempered by a chaotic
smith. Note that this spell is not reversible.

					<p>         This spell grants supernatural strength to the recipient by raising his Strength
score by 1d4 points or to a minimum of 16, whichever is higher. Each 10% of exceptional
Strength counts as 1 point, so a character with a Strength of 17 could be raised as high as
an 18/30, but no higher. Both the priest and the recipient must be in contact with solid
stone or earth when the spell is cast--standing on the ground will do nicely, but flying or
swimming will not. The spell lasts for 3 rounds plus 1 round per caster level or until the
subject loses contact with the earth. Obviously, this can happen in a number of ways,
including being picked up or grappled by a larger creature, being knocked through the air
by an impact or explosion, or even being magically moved in some fashion.

by the ray sustains 1d6 points of damage, plus 1 point per caster level. Undead creatures

					<p>   The recipient of this spell gains the benefit of a bless spell (+1 to attack rolls and
saving throws) and a special bonus of 1d8 additional hit points for the duration of the
spell. The aid spell enables the recipient to actually have more hit points than his full
normal total. The bonus hit points are lost first when the recipient takes damage; they
cannot be regained by curative magic.

   For example, a 1st-level fighter has 8 hit points, suffers 2 points of damage (8-2 = 6),
and then receives an aid spell that gives 5 additional hit points. The fighter now has 11 hit
points, 5 of which are temporary. If he is then hit for 7 points of damage, 2 normal hit
points and all 5 temporary hit points are lost. He then receives a cure light wounds spell
that heals 4 points of damage, restoring him to his original 8 hit points.

   Note that the operation of the spell is unaffected by permanent hit point losses due to
energy drain, Hit Die losses, the loss of a familiar, or the operation of certain artifacts; the
temporary hit point gain is figured from the new, lower total.

   The material components of this spell are a tiny strip of white cloth with a sticky
substance (such as tree sap) on the ends, plus the priest's holy symbol.

					<p>   The priest casting an augury spell seeks to divine whether an action in the immediate
future (within one-half hour) will benefit or harm the party. For example, if a party is
considering the destruction of a weird seal that closes a portal, an augury spell can be
used to find if weal or woe will be the immediate result. If the spell is successful, the DM
yields some indication of the probable outcome: "weal," "woe," or possibly a cryptic
puzzle or rhyme. The base chance for receiving a meaningful reply is 70%, plus 1% for
each level of the priest casting the spell; for example, 71% at 1st level, 72% at 2nd, etc.
Your DM determines any adjustments for the particular conditions of each augury.

   For example, if the question is "Will we do well if we venture to the third level?" and a
terrible troll guarding 10,000 sp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level
(which the DM estimates the party could beat after a hard fight), the augury might be:
"Great risk brings great reward." If the troll is too strong for the party, the augury might
be: "Woe and destruction await!" Likewise, a party casting several auguries about the
same action in quick succession might receive identical answers, regardless of the dice
rolls.

   The material component for an augury spell is a set of gem-inlaid sticks, dragon bones,
or similar tokens of at least 1,000 gp value (which are not expended in casting).

damage rolls and saving throws made by those in the area of effect who are friendly to
the priest gain +1 bonuses, while those of the priest's enemies suffer -1 penalties. This
bonus/penalty continues as long as the caster continues to chant the mystic syllables and
is stationary. However, an interruption (such as an attack that succeeds and causes
damage, grappling with the chanter, or a silence spell) breaks the spell. Multiple chants
are not cumulative; however, if the 3rd-level prayer spell is spoken while a priest of the
same religious persuasion (not merely alignment) is chanting, the effect is increased to +2 and -2.

				<div id="description-content">
					<p>   This spell affects any single person or mammal it is cast upon. The creature then
regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The term person
includes any bipedal human, demihuman or humanoid of man size or smaller, including
brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-elves, halflings, half-orcs,
hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies, sprites, troglodytes, and
others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter is included, while an ogre is not.

   The spell does not enable the caster to control the charmed creature as if it were an
automaton, but any word or action of the caster is viewed in the most favorable way.
Thus, a charmed creature would not obey a suicide command, but might believe the
caster if assured that the only chance to save the caster's life is for the creature to hold
back an onrushing red dragon for "just a minute or two" and if the charmed creature's
view of the situation suggests that this course of action still allows a reasonable chance of
survival.

   The subject's attitudes and priorities are changed with respect to the caster, but basic
personality and alignment are not. A request that a victim make itself defenseless, give up
a valued item, or even use a charge from a valued item (especially against former
associates or allies) might allow an immediate saving throw to see if the charm is thrown
off. Likewise, a charmed creature does not necessarily reveal everything it knows or draw
maps of entire areas. Any request may be refused, if such refusal is in character and does
not directly harm the caster. The victim's regard for the caster does not necessarily extend
to the caster's friends or allies. The victim does not react well to the charmer's allies
making suggestions such as, "Ask him this question. . .," nor does the charmed creature
put up with verbal or physical abuse from the charmer's associates, if this is out of
character.

   Note also that the spell does not empower the caster with linguistic capabilities beyond
those he normally has. The duration of the spell is a function of the charmed creature's
Intelligence, and it is tied to the saving throw. A successful saving throw breaks the spell.
This saving throw is checked on a periodic basis according to the creature's Intelligence,
even if the caster has not overly strained the relationship.

Intelligence Score  Period Between Checks
3 or less		3 months
4-6		2 months
7-9		1 month
10-12               3 weeks
13-14               2 weeks
15-16       1 week
17          3 days
18          2 days
19 or more  1 day

   If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or
if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm is broken
automatically.

   If the subject of the charm person/charm mammal spell successfully rolls its saving
throw vs. the spell, the effect is negated.

   This spell, if used in conjunction with the animal friendship spell, can keep the animal
near the caster's home base, if the caster must leave for an extended period.

					<p>   When used by a priest, this spell can detect if a person or monster is under the
influence of a charm spell, or similar control such as hypnosis, suggestion, beguiling,
possession, etc. The creature rolls a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, the caster
learns nothing about that particular creature from the casting. A caster who learns that a
creature is being influenced has a 5% chance per level to determine the exact type of
influence. Up to 10 different creatures can be checked before the spell wanes. If the
creature is under more than one such effect, only the information that the charms exist is
gained. The type (since there are conflicting emanations) is impossible to determine.

   The reverse of the spell, undetectable charm, completely masks all charms on a single
creature for 24 hours.

					<p>   A priest using this spell can enthrall an audience that can fully understand his
language. Those in the area of effect must successfully save vs. spell or give the caster
their undivided attention, totally ignoring their surroundings. Those of a race or religion
unfriendly to the caster's have a +4 bonus to the roll. Any Wisdom adjustment also
applies. Creatures with 4 or more levels or Hit Dice, or with a Wisdom of 16 or better,
are unaffected.

   To cast the spell, the caster must speak without interruption for a full round.
Thereafter, the enchantment lasts as long as the priest speaks, to a maximum of one hour.
Those enthralled take no action while the priest speaks, and for 1d3 rounds thereafter
while they discuss the matter. Those entering the area of effect must also successfully
save vs. spell or become enthralled. Those not enthralled are 50% likely every turn to
hoot and jeer in unison. If there is excessive jeering, the rest are allowed a new saving
throw. The speech ends (but the 1d3 round delay still applies) if the priest is successfully
attacked or performs any action other than speaking.

   If the audience is attacked, the spell ends and the audience reacts immediately, rolling
a reaction check with respect to the source of the interruption, at a penalty of -10.

   Note: When handling a large number of saving throws for similar creatures, the DM
can assume an average to save time; for example, a crowd of 20 men with a base saving
throw of 16 (25% success chance) will have 15 men enthralled and five not.

				<div id="description-content">
					<p>   When a priest casts a find traps spell, all traps--concealed normally or magically--of
magical or mechanical nature become apparent to him. Note that this spell is directional,
and the caster must face the desired direction in order to determine if a trap is laid in that
particular direction.

   A trap is any device or magical ward that meets three criteria: it can inflict a sudden or
unexpected result, the spellcaster would view the result as undesirable or harmful, and the
harmful or undesirable result was specifically intended as such by the creator. Thus, traps
include alarms, glyphs, and similar spells or devices.

   The caster learns the general nature of the trap (magical or mechanical) but not its
exact effect, nor how to disarm it. Close examination will, however, enable the caster to
sense what intended actions might trigger it. Note that the caster's divination is limited to
his knowledge of what might be unexpected and harmful. The spell cannot predict actions
of creatures (hence, a concealed murder hole or ambush is not a trap), nor are natural
hazards considered traps (a cavern that floods during a rain, a wall weakened by age, a
naturally poisonous plant, etc.). If the DM is using specific glyphs or sigils to identify
magical wards (see the 3rd-level spell glyph of warding), this spell shows the form of the
glyph or mark. The spell does not detect traps that have been disarmed or are otherwise
inactive.

					<p>   This spell holds 1d4 humans, demihumans, or humanoid creatures rigidly immobile
and in place for a minimum of six rounds (the spell lasts 2 rounds per caster level, and the
priest must be of at least 3rd level to cast the spell).

   The hold person spell affects any bipedal human, demihuman, or humanoid of man
size or smaller, including brownies, dryads, dwarves, elves, gnolls, gnomes, goblins, half-
elves, halflings, half-orcs, hobgoblins, humans, kobolds, lizard men, nixies, orcs, pixies,
sprites, troglodytes, and others. Thus, a 10th-level fighter could be held, while an ogre
could not.

   The effect is centered on a point selected by the caster, and it affects persons selected
by the caster within the area of effect. If the spell is cast at three persons, each gets a
normal saving throw; if only two persons are being enspelled, each rolls his saving throw
with a -1 penalty; if the spell is cast at only one person, the saving throw die roll suffers a
-2 penalty. Saving throws are adjusted for Wisdom. Those who succeed on their saving
throws are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held.

   Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them
and can use abilities not requiring motion or speech. Being held does not prevent the
worsening of the subjects' condition due to wounds, disease, or poison. The priest casting
the hold person spell can end the spell with a single utterance at any time; otherwise, the
duration is six rounds at 3rd level, eight rounds at 4th level, etc.

   The spellcaster needs a small, straight piece of iron as the material component of this
spell.

					<p>   Upon casting this spell, complete silence prevails in the affected area. All sound is
stopped: Conversation is impossible, spells cannot be cast (or at least not those with
verbal components, if the optional component rule is used), and no noise whatsoever
issues from or enters the area. The spell can be cast into the air or upon an object, but the
effect is stationary unless cast on a mobile object or creature. The spell lasts two rounds
for each level of experience of the priest. The spell can be centered upon a creature, and
the effect then radiates from the creature and moves as it moves. An unwilling creature
receives a saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw is successful, the spell effect
is centered about 1 foot behind the position of the subject creature at the instant of
casting. This spell provides a defense against sound-based attacks, such as harpy singing,
horn of blasting, etc.

					<p>   When this spell is placed upon a poisoned individual, it greatly slows the effects of
venom, if cast upon the victim before the poison takes full effect. (This period, known as
the onset time, is known to the DM.) While this spell does not neutralize the venom, it
does prevent it from substantially harming the individual for the duration of its magic in
the hope that, during that spell period, the poison can be fully cured.

   The material components of the slow poison spell are the priest's holy symbol and a
bud of garlic that must be crushed and smeared on the wound (or eaten if poison was
ingested).

					<p>   When this spell is cast, a hypnotic pattern is set up that causes one or more snakes to
cease all activity except a semierect, swaying movement. If the snakes are charmed while
in a torpor, the duration of the spell is 1d4+2 turns; if the snakes are not torpid, but are
not aroused and angry, the charm lasts 1d3 turns; if the snakes are angry or attacking, the
spell lasts 1d4+4 rounds. The priest casting the spell can charm snakes whose total hit
points are less than or equal to those of the priest. On the average, a 1st-level priest could
charm snakes with a total of 4 or 5 hit points; a 2nd-level priest could charm 9 hit points,
etc. The hit points can be those of a single snake or those of several of the reptiles, but the
total hit points cannot exceed those of the priest casting the spell. A 23-hit point caster
charming a dozen 2-hit point snakes would charm 11 of them. This spell is also effective
against any ophidian or ophidianoid monster, such as naga, couatl, etc., subject to magic
resistance, hit points, and so forth.

   Variations of this spell may exist, allowing other creatures significant to a particular
mythos to be affected. Your DM will inform you if such spells exist.

					<p>   This spell empowers the priest to comprehend and communicate with any warm- or
cold-blooded normal or giant animal that is not mindless. The priest is able to ask
questions of and receive answers from the creature, although friendliness and cooperation
are by no means assured. Furthermore, terseness and evasiveness are likely in basically
wary and cunning creatures (the more stupid ones will instead make inane comments). If
the animal is friendly or of the same general alignment as the priest, it may do some favor
or service for the priest (as determined by the DM). Note that this spell differs from the
speak with monsters spell, for this spell allows conversation only with normal or giant
nonfantastic creatures such as apes, bears, cats, dogs, elephants, and so on.

					<p>   By calling upon his deity, the caster of a spiritual hammer spell brings into existence a
field of force shaped vaguely like a hammer. As long as the caster concentrates upon the
hammer, it strikes at any opponent within its range, as desired. Each round the caster can
choose to attack the same target as the previous round or switch to a new target that he
can see anywhere within his maximum range. The spiritual hammer's chance to
successfully hit is equal to that of the caster, without any Strength bonuses. In addition, it
strikes as a magical weapon with a bonus of +1 for every six experience levels (or
fraction) of the spellcaster, up to a total of +3 to the attack roll and +3 to the damage roll
for a 13th-level caster. The base damage inflicted when it scores a hit is exactly the same
as a normal war hammer (1d4+1 points on opponents of man size or smaller, or 1d4
points on larger opponents, plus the magical bonus). The hammer strikes in the same
direction as the caster is facing, so if he is behind the target, all bonuses for rear attack are
gained along with the loss of any modifications to the target's AC for shield and
Dexterity.

   As soon as the caster ceases concentration, the spiritual hammer spell ends. A dispel
magic spell that includes either the caster or the force in its area of effect has a chance to
dispel the spiritual hammer. If an attacked creature has magic resistance, the resistance is
checked the first time the spiritual hammer strikes. If the hammer is successfully resisted,
the spell is lost. If not, the hammer has its normal full effect for the duration of the spell.

   The material component of this spell is a normal war hammer that the priest must hurl
toward opponents while uttering a plea to his deity. The hammer disappears when the
spell is cast.

					<p>   By means of a withdraw spell, the priest in effect alters the flow of time with regard to
himself. While but one round of time passes for those not affected by the spell, the priest
is able to spend two rounds, plus one round per level, in contemplation. Thus, a 5th-level
priest can withdraw for seven rounds to cogitate on some matter while one round passes
for all others. (The DM should allow the player one minute of real time per round
withdrawn to ponder some problem or question. No discussion with other players is
permitted.) Note that while affected by the withdraw spell, the caster can use only the
following spells: any divination spell or any curing or healing spell, the latter on himself
only. The casting of any of these spells in different fashion (for example, a cure light
wounds spell bestowed upon a companion) negates the withdraw spell. Similarly, the
withdrawn caster cannot walk or run, become invisible, or engage in actions other than
thinking, reading, and the like. He can be affected by the actions of others, losing any
Dexterity or shield bonus. Any successful attack upon the caster breaks the spell.

					<p>   This spell is known as wyvern watch because of the insubstantial haze brought forth by
its casting, which vaguely resembles a wyvern. It is typically used to guard some area
against intrusion. Any creature approaching within 10 feet of the guarded area may be
affected by the "wyvern." Any creature entering the guarded area must roll a successful
saving throw vs. spell or stand paralyzed for one round per level of the caster, until freed
by the spellcaster, by a dispel magic spell, or by a remove paralysis spell. A successful
saving throw indicates that the subject creature was missed by the attack of the wyvern-
form, and the spell remains in place. As soon as a subject creature is successfully struck
by the wyvern-form, the paralysis takes effect and the force of the spell dissipates. The
spell force likewise dissipates if no intruder is struck by the wyvern-form for eight hours
after the spell is cast. Any creature approaching the space being guarded by the wyvern-
form may be able to detect its presence before coming close enough to be attacked; this
chance of detection is 90% in bright light, 30% in twilight conditions, and 0% in
darkness.

   The material component is the priest's holy symbol.

					<p>    This spell temporarily calms a chaotic situation involving a group of people. The
situation may involve any range of emotions from violence (as in a barroom brawl) to joy
and merrymaking (as in a festival or carnival).

    Unlike the emotion spell, calm chaos does not cause a change in the emotions of
affected creatures--anger, fear, or intense joy remain in each individual. The emotion is
simply restrained rather than released. Thus, an angry character intent on attacking
someone will still feel the desire to do so, but he will withhold his action as long as the
spell remains in effect.

    Creatures to be affected are allowed a saving throw vs. spell at a -4 penalty to avoid
the effects. If more creatures are present than can be affected, creatures nearest the caster
are affected first.

    After casting the spell, the priest makes a Charisma check. If successful, all characters
affected by the spell are compelled to stop what they are doing. They are filled with the
sensation that something important is about to occur. At this time, the priest or a
character of his choosing must gain the attention of the affected creatures by giving a
speech, performing for the crowd, or casting spells with intriguing visual effects (such as
dancing lights). The attention of the crowd is then held for as long as the distraction
continues. A character could filibuster and maintain control over the affected characters
for hours or days.

    Two conditions will cause the group to resume its original actions. In the first, the
method of entertaining the crowd ceases for one round--the speech ends or the spell
expires. If this action is not replaced with another distraction within one round, the crowd
is freed of the spell.

    In the second condition, if an event occurs that is more immediate than the
distraction, the crowd will divert its attention to that event. Thus, if the spell were used to
stop a barroom brawl and the building caught fire or was attacked, the crowd's attention
would be diverted and the individuals could act freely.

    Creatures whose attention is held by the spell cannot be instructed to attack or
perform any action. Such creatures will ignore suggestions of this nature. Depending on
the nature of the request, the DM may deem that the suggestion causes a distraction that
ends the spell.

					<p>    When this spell is cast, the priest's body shudders and glows with a shimmering aura
as it becomes a vessel for the power of his god. As a result, the caster may choose to
increase one ability score (only Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma are
eligible) by +1 per three levels of his experience (+1 at 3rd level, +2 at 6th, etc.).

    Only one attribute may be increased. The effect lasts for the duration of the spell.
Attributes may be increased above the normal restrictions due to race and class, to a
maximum of +6. All benefits for exceptional attributes listed in the Player's Handbook
apply; however, the divine abilities found in the Legends & Lore book cannot be gained
by use of this spell.

    For example, an 18th-level priest with Strength 15 could increase his Strength to 21
for 18 rounds, granting him a +4 attack bonus, a +9 damage adjustment, etc.

    When the spell ends, the energy abruptly leaves the priest's body, leaving him
physically and mentally drained. He is nearly comatose and can do nothing but rest for
the next 4d6 turns. A successful Constitution check (at the priest's normal attribute score)
reduces this time by 50%.

    The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a vial of holy water that has
been blessed by the high priest of the character's faith.

					<p>    With this spell, the caster can enchant a chest, book, or any other nonliving object no
larger than a 10'x10'x10' cube. When any creature other than the caster comes within
three feet of the enchanted object, it instantly sprouts appendages and moves away from
the creature as quickly as possible. The enchanted object continues to move until it is at
least 10 feet away from the nearest creatures in the area.

    After the enchanted object has moved a satisfactory distance from the nearest
creature, the appendages disappear. When a creature again comes within three feet of the
enchanted object, the enchanted object sprouts appendages and flees. This process
continues until the enchantment is negated (through a dispel magic or similar spell) or the
enchanted object is subdued or destroyed.

B), or fins (Sw 24), whichever is most advantageous. Thus, a book on a shelf might
sprout wings and fly away, while a table might gallop around a room. The enchanted
object can freely and instantly trade appendages as necessary.

    The enchanted object will move only through open spaces. It will not crash through
windows, shatter a closed door, or dig through the earth. It cannot attack or take any
actions other than movement. If surrounded or cornered, the enchanted object moves in
random directions until it is restrained or destroyed.

    The enchantment ends if the caster voluntarily negates it, if the enchanted object is
destroyed (the object has the same vulnerabilities as it has in its normal state), or if the
enchanted object is restrained for 2-5 (1d4+1) consecutive rounds. Restraint means that
the object is prevented from fleeing; if a creature is able to grapple, lift, or sit on the
object, it is considered restrained. A creature capable of lifting the object in its normal
state is considered strong enough to restrain it (for instance, a person capable of lifting a
50-pound box is also capable of restraining such a box enchanted by frisky chest). The
object may also be restrained by tossing a net or heavy blanket over it or by surrounding
it with several characters.

    The material components are a dried frog's leg, a feather, and a fish scale.

					<p>    With this spell, the priest creates tones and harmonies of such unearthly beauty and
complexity that they entrance the listener, making it difficult for the listener to attack or
otherwise harm the priest. The listener receives a normal saving throw against this effect.
Failure means that the listener is entranced and is unable to attack the priest for the
duration of the spell.

    In addition, the music makes the subject gullible and more susceptible to charm
magics such as charm person, suggestion, and hypnotism. While the music spell is in
effect, the subject saves against charm spells with a -3 penalty.

    This spell does not protect other characters in company with the priest; listeners who
have fallen prey to the music are free to attack anyone else. The spell effect ends instantly
if the priest takes any hostile action against a creature under the influence of the spell.

    Music of the spheres can affect one creature per three levels of the priest (one subject
at 3rd level, two at 6th level, etc.). Subjects must be within a 20-foot-diameter circle.

    Potential victims must have Intelligence of at least 1 (necessary to understand the
concept of music) and must be able to hear the music (i.e., they cannot be deaf and there
can be nothing obstructing the victim's ears). This also means that the level of
background noise must be low enough for the music to be audible. The DM should
assume that the music is the same volume as an average human's normal speaking voice.
If the potential subject could not hear speech at the appropriate range under prevailing
conditions, the spell cannot affect that subject. The spell would be virtually useless in the
midst of a full-scale battle or during a hurricane.

    The material component comprises a set of three small bows made from fine silver,
each costing 100 gp. The lengths of the bows must be in the ratio of 1 to 4 to 9. The priest
strokes these bows together in an intricate sequence while casting the spell. The bows are
not consumed in the casting.

					<p>    This spell is one of the few cooperative spells that requires one priest to cast the
transfer spell, but another priest to use its effect. On one round, a priest (or priests) casts
the mystic transfer. The spell is then active for the remaining nine rounds of the turn.

    Mystic transfer allows a priest to receive spells from another priest of the same ethos.
Any priest of the same religion can cast a spell and transfer it to a second priest within
that spell's maximum range. The spell does not take effect; instead, it is channelled
through the mystic transfer into the receiving priest. This priest must immediately cast the
spell or pass it to another priest cloaked in a mystic transfer within the spell's range. Any
number of transfers can be made in the same round, provided each new recipient is within
spell range of the previous recipient. If the spell is not transferred, the spell takes effect.

    For example, a 3rd-level priest casts a mystic transfer. On the following round, a
10th-level priest "passes" a flame strike to the 3rd-level priest. The two priests could be
60 yards apart (the maximum range of the flame strike). The 3rd-level priest could then
use the flame strike to attack any target within 60 yards, or could pass the spell on to
another priest who has an active mystic transfer.

    The spell passed by the mystic transfer has the range, area of effect, damage, and
other effects equal to the level of the original caster. In the example above, the flame
strike would function as if cast by a 10th-level priest.

    The mystic transfer does not require concentration. However, on any round in which
a priest is receiving and/or transferring a spell, the caster cannot take any other significant
action.

    A priest can receive spells only from priests who worship the same deity and who
specifically target spells to him. Area effect spells may be passed. A priest can never use
mystic transfer to pluck an opponent's spells out of the air.

check during the Magic Phase, rather than forcing the unit to wait for the Rally Phase in
the BATTLESYSTEMTM rules. If the priest casting the spell is of 12th level or higher,
the subject unit receives a +1 bonus to its rally check die roll. The priest must have an
uninterrupted line of sight to the unit.

represents the cause for which the unit is fighting (such as a national flag or the blazon of
the unit's liege lord). The pennant is consumed in the casting.

					<p>    This cooperative spell allows the priests to create a beneficial atmosphere within a
specified area. Companions of similar alignment to the casters will feel fortified and
encouraged while in the sanctified area. The spell can be cast by a single priest or a group
of priests.
    After casting sanctify, the affected area is imbued with the deity's majesty. For
followers of that deity, the area radiates a holy aura. These followers gain a +2 bonus to
saving throws against all fear- and charm-based powers (a +2 to morale for
BATTLESYSTEMTM rules units). Persons of the same alignment as the caster but of
different faiths gain a +1 to saving throws (+1 in BATTLESYSTEM rules). The effect
applies only as long as the characters remain in the sanctified area.

    Creatures intent on harming the priest or his followers suffer a -1 on saving throws vs.
fear and charm (-1 to morale for BATTLESYSTEM rules units) when on sanctified
ground.

    Undead creatures within the area are easier to turn; any priest standing on sanctified
ground turns undead as if he were one level higher.

    Although this spell can be cast by a single priest, it is most effective when cast by
several priests at once. The duration of the spell is equal to one round per level of the
caster. When several priests cast the spell, the level of the most powerful priest is used,
with two rounds added for every contributing priest. Thus, one 8th-level and three 6th-
level priests would give the spell a duration of 14 rounds (8+2+2+2).

    Sanctify is often used in conjunction with focus to protect the grounds of a temple or
encourage men defending a castle.

    The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of dirt from the
grounds of an existing temple of the same faith.

    The reverse of this spell, defile, functions in an identical manner with respect to
saving throws for charm and fear. However, priests standing on defiled ground who
attempt to turn undead do so at one level lower than their current level.

    The material components for the reverse are the priest's holy symbol and a handful of
earth from a grave.

					<p>    This spell prevents creatures within the area of effect (or those who enter it) from
speaking any deliberate and knowing lies. Creatures are allowed a saving throw to avoid
the effects; those who fail the save are affected fully. Affected characters are aware of
this enchantment; therefore, they may avoid answering questions to which they would
normally respond with a lie or they may be evasive as long as they remain within the
boundaries of the truth. When a character leaves the area, he is free to speak as he
chooses.

4th-level priest could affect a 20 foot by 20 foot square.

					<p>         Somewhat less common than the well-known cure light wounds and cure serious
wounds, this healing spell was created by a priest who found that his heroic companions
required his skill at doctoring more than his advice and wisdom. By laying his hand on
the subject's body, the priest can heal 1d10+1 points of damage. Noncorporeal,
nonliving, or extraplanar creatures cannot be healed by this spell. The reverse of this
spell, cause moderate wounds, requires the priest to successfully touch the victim and
inflicts 1d10+1 points of damage. (The knockdown and critical strike entries above are
for spell's reverse.)

					<p>         The ethereal barrier is a defense against the passage of extradimensional
creatures, including characters or monsters that are phased, ethereal, or travelling via
dimension door or shadow walk. The priest creates an imperceptible barrier of 10 square
feet per level that may be arranged in any fashion the priest desires. For example, a
3rd-level character can ward six 10-foot by 10-foot surfaces, which would be sufficient to
guard a 10-foot by 10-foot by 10-foot room (four walls, a ceiling, and a floor need to be
protected.) Note that some monsters may be capable of abandoning their ethereal
approach in order to simply enter the barred area on their own feet--the ethereal barrier
only bars their passage as long as they are traveling in the Border Ethereal. Also, while
this spell can't be worn down by any form of attack, it does not bar teleportation, gates,
or the passage of astral creatures.

         Ethereal barrier may be cast as cooperative magic by several priests working
together. As long as all involved characters can cast the spell, the areas of effect of each
priest are added together. Total the levels of all priests involved and multiply by two to
find the number of 10-foot by 10-foot squares that may be warded. For example, four
6th-level casters (24 total levels) can ward 48 10-foot by 10-foot squares. The duration is
determined by the highest level priest involved, plus 1 turn for each additional priest. In
the previous example, this would be 6 turns plus 3 turns for three additional priests for a
total of 9 turns.

         This spell is also suitable for focus magic (see the spell focus in the Tome of
Magic). The material component is a special compound of rare earths and lead worth at
least 10 gp per application. One application is required for each 10-foot by 10-foot square
to be warded.

					<p>         This spell allows the priest to ignore hunger, thirst, and extremes of climate for an
extended period of time. While the spell is in effect, the priest requires no food or drink.
He is effectively immune to exposure, dehydration, and heat or cold injury, since no
naturally occurring climatic condition will cause him harm. (Lightning, floods, tornadoes,
earthquakes, and other such hazardous phenomena can still cause physical injury, of
course.)

         During the iron vigil, the priest is able to ignore the need to sleep by choosing to
meditate instead. While meditating, the priest can keep watch on his surroundings, but he
suffers a +1 penalty to any surprise checks. If the character wishes to memorize spells, he
must sleep normally.
         At the vigil's end, the priest must eat and drink; if no food or water is available,

the character must make a Constitution check once every four hours at a cumulative ­1
penalty or fall into a coma and perish within 1d3 days if he receives no aid. He also
requires at least four hours of rest for each day that he did not eat, drink, or sleep during
his vigil.

Melf's acid arrow, and the natural attacks of various puddings, oozes, slimes, and jellies)
inflict only half the normal damage on the protected character. If the attack requires a
saving throw, the subject gains a +3 bonus, sustaining half damage with a failed save or
one-quarter damage with a successful saving throw.

					<p>         This spell removes unnatural weakness, debilitation, or exhaustion from the
creature touched and restores him to his normal strength and stamina. It is useful in
countering the effects of chill touch, ray of enfeeblement, ray of fatigue, the touch of a
shadow or roper, and any similar spell or effect. Only temporary ability score losses may
be alleviated by this spell; if a character suffers an incapacitating, physical injury, restore
strength cannot help him. Also, loss of strength or stamina from purely natural causes
such as exposure, disease, or exertion is not repaired by restore strength. The duration is
permanent in that the subject remains at his maximum strength and endurance only until
he is drained (or exerts himself) again.

					<p>         When this spell is cast, all natural, undressed earth or stone in the area of effect is
softened. Wet earth becomes thick mud; dry earth becomes loose sand or dirt; and stone
becomes soft clay, easily molded or chopped. The priest affects a 10-foot square area to a
depth of 1 to 4 feet, depending on the toughness or resilience of the ground at that spot
(DM option). Magical or enchanted stone cannot be affected by this spell, nor can dressed
or worked stone.

         Creatures attempting to move through an area softened into mud are reduced to a
move of 10 feet per round. Any creatures caught within the mud when the spell takes
effect must make a saving throw vs. paralyzation or lose the ability to move, attack, or
cast spells for 1d2 rounds as they flounder about in the muck. Loose dirt is not as
troublesome as mud, and creatures are only reduced to half their normal movement rate,
with no chance of being caught for a round or two. However, it is impossible to run,
sprint, or charge over either surface.

         Stone softened into clay does not hinder movement, but it does allow characters to
cut, shape, or excavate areas they may not have been able to affect before. For example, a
party of PCs trying to break out of a cavern might use this spell to soften a wall.

         While soften earth and stone does not affect dressed or worked stone, vertical
surfaces such as cliff faces or cavern ceilings can be affected. Usually, this causes a
moderate collapse or landslide as the loosened material peels away from the face or roof
and falls. A moderate amount of structural damage can be inflicted to man-made
structures by softening the ground beneath a wall or tower, causing it to settle. However,
most well-built structures will only be damaged by this spell, not destroyed. The material
component is a bit of slip (wet clay) from the wheel of a master potter.

					<p>   This spell creates the lowest of the undead monsters, skeletons or zombies, usually
from the bones or bodies of dead humans, demihumans, or humanoids. The spell causes
these remains to become animated and obey the simple verbal commands of the caster,
regardless of how they communicated in life. The skeletons or zombies can follow the
caster, remain in an area and attack any creature (or just a specific type of creature)
entering the place, etc. The undead remain animated until they are destroyed in combat or
are turned; the magic cannot be dispelled.

   The priest can animate one skeleton or one zombie for each experience level he has
attained. If creatures with more than 1+ Hit Dice are animated, the number is determined
by the monster Hit Dice. Skeletal forms have the Hit Dice of the original creature, while
zombie forms have 1 more Hit Die. Thus, a 12th-level priest could animate 12 dwarven
skeletons (or six zombies), four zombie gnolls, or a single zombie fire giant. Note that
this is based on the standard racial Hit Die norm; thus, a high-level adventurer would be
animated as a skeleton or zombie of 1 or 2 Hit Dice, and without special class or racial
abilities. The caster can, alternatively, animate two small animal skeletons (1-1 Hit Die or
less) for every level of experience he has achieved.

   The spell requires a drop of blood, a piece of flesh of the type of creature being
animated, and a pinch of bone powder or a bone shard to complete the spell. Casting this
spell is not a good act, and only evil priests use it frequently.

					<p>   This spell is similar to a light spell, except that it is as bright as full daylight and lasts
until negated by magical darkness or by a dispel magic spell. Creatures with penalties in
bright light suffer them in this spell's area of effect. As with the light spell, this can be
cast into the air, onto an object, or at a creature. In the third case, the continual light
affects the space about 1 foot behind a creature that successfully rolls its saving throw vs.
spell (a failed saving throw means the continual light is centered on the creature and
moves as it moves). Note that this spell also blinds a creature if it is successfully cast
upon the creature's visual organs. If the spell is cast on a small object that is then placed
in a light-proof covering, the spell effects are blocked until the covering is removed.

   Continual light brought into an area of magical darkness (or vice versa) cancels the
darkness so that the otherwise prevailing light conditions exist in the overlapping areas of
effect. A direct casting of a continual light spell against a similar or weaker magical
darkness cancels both.

   This spell eventually consumes the material it is cast upon, but the process takes far
longer than the time in a typical campaign. Extremely hard and expensive materials might
last hundreds or even thousands of years.

					<p>   By touching the creature afflicted, the priest employing the spell can permanently cure
some forms of blindness or deafness. This spell does not restore or repair visual or
auditory organs damaged by injury or disease.

   Its reverse, cause blindness or deafness, requires a successful touch (successful attack

the saving throw is failed, a nondamaging magical blindness or deafness results.
   A deafened creature can react only to what it can see or feel, and suffers a -1 penalty to

					<p>   This spell enables the caster to cure most diseases by placing his hand upon the
diseased creature. The affliction rapidly disappears thereafter, making the cured creature
whole and well in from one turn to 10 days, depending on the type of disease and the
state of its advancement when the cure took place. (The DM must adjudicate these
conditions.) The spell is also effective against parasitic monsters such as green slime, rot
grubs, and others. When cast by a priest of at least 12th level, this spell cures lycanthropy
if cast within three days of the infection. Note that the spell does not prevent reoccurrence
of a disease if the recipient is again exposed.

   The reverse of the cure disease spell is cause disease. To be effective, the priest must
touch the intended victim, and the victim must fail a saving throw vs. spell. The severity
of the disease is decided by the priest (debilitating or fatal). The exact details of the
disease are decided by the DM, but the following are typical:

   Debilitating: The disease takes effect in 1d6 turns, after which the creature loses 1
point of Strength per hour until his Strength is reduced to 2 or less, at which time the
recipient is weak and virtually helpless. If a creature has no Strength rating, it loses 10%
of its hit points per Strength loss, down to 10% of its original hit points. If the disease
also affects hit points, use the more severe penalty. Recovery requires a period of 1d3
weeks.

   Fatal: This wasting disease is effective immediately. Infected creatures receive no
benefit from cure wound spells while the disease is in effect; wounds heal at only 10% of
the natural rate. The disease proves fatal within 1d6 months and can be cured only by
magical means. Each month the disease progresses, the creature loses 2 points of
Charisma, permanently.

   The inflicted disease can be cured by the cure disease spell. Lycanthropy cannot be
caused.

					<p>   When a priest casts this spell, it has a chance to neutralize or negate the magic it comes
in contact with as follows:

   First, it has a chance to remove spells and spell-like effects (including device effects
and innate abilities) from creatures or objects. Second, it may disrupt the casting or use of
these in the area of effect at the instant the dispel is cast. Third, it may destroy magical
potions (which are treated as 12th level for purposes of this spell).

   Each effect or potion in the spell's area is checked to determine if it is dispelled. The
caster can always dispel his own magic; otherwise, the chance depends on the difference
in level between the magical effect and the caster. The base chance of successfully
dispelling is 11 or higher on 1d20. If the caster is of higher level than the creator of the
effect to be dispelled, the difference is subtracted from this base number needed. If the
caster is of lower level, the difference is added to the base. A die roll of 20 always
succeeds and a die roll of 1 always fails. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the
magic he is trying to dispel, only a roll of 1 prevents the effect from being dispelled.

   A dispel magic can affect only a specially enchanted item (such as a magical scroll,
ring, wand, rod, staff, miscellaneous item, weapon, shield, or armor) if it is cast directly
upon the item. This renders the item nonoperational for 1d4 rounds. An item possessed or
carried by a creature has the creature's saving throw against this effect; otherwise, it is
automatically rendered nonoperational. An interdimensional interface (such as a bag of
holding) rendered nonoperational is temporarily closed. Note that an item's physical
properties are unchanged: A nonoperational magical sword is still a sword.

   Artifacts and relics are not subject to this spell, but some of their spell-like effects may
be, at the DM's option.

   Note that this spell, if successful, will release charmed and similarly beguiled
creatures. Certain spells or effects cannot be dispelled; these are listed in the spell
descriptions.

					<p>   By means of this spell, the caster or any other willing person can be put into a
cataleptic state that is impossible to distinguish from actual death. Although the person
affected can smell, hear, and know what is going on, no feeling or sight of any sort is
possible; thus, any wounding or mistreatment of the body is not felt, no reaction occurs,
and damage is only one-half normal. In addition, paralysis, poison, or energy level drain

introduced into the body becomes effective when the spell recipient is no longer under
the influence of this spell, although a saving throw is permitted. However, the spell offers
no protection from causes of certain death--being crushed under a landslide, etc. Only a
willing individual can be affected by a feign death spell. The priest is able to end the spell
effect at any time, but it requires a full round for bodily functions to begin again.

   Note that, unlike the wizard version of this spell, only people can be affected, and that
those of any level can be affected by the priest casting this spell.

					<p>A glyph of warding is a powerful inscription magically drawn to prevent unauthorized
.or hostile creatures from passing, entering, or opening. It can be used to guard a small
bridge, to ward an entry, or as a trap on a chest or box.

   The priest must set the conditions of the ward; typically any creature violating the
warded area without speaking the name of the glyph is subject to the magic it stores. A
successful saving throw vs. spell enables the creature to escape the effects of the glyph.
Glyphs can be set according to physical characteristics, such as creature type, size, and
weight. Glyphs can also be set with respect to good or evil, or to pass those of the caster's
religion. They cannot be set according to class, Hit Dice, or level. Multiple glyphs cannot
be cast on the same area; although if a cabinet had three drawers, each could be
separately warded.

   When the spell is cast, the priest weaves a tracery of faintly glowing lines around the
warding sigil. For every 5 square feet of area to be protected, one round is required to
trace the warding lines of the glyph. The caster can affect an area equal to a square the
sides of which are the same as his level, in feet. The glyph can be placed to conform to
any shape up to the limitations of the caster's total square footage. Thus, a 6th-level caster
could place a glyph on a 6-foot x 6-foot square, a 4-foot x 9-foot rectangle, a 2-foot x 18-
foot band, or a 1-foot by 36-foot strip. When the spell is completed, the glyph and tracery
become invisible.

   The priest traces the glyph with incense, which, if the area exceeds 50 square feet,
must be sprinkled with powdered diamond (at least 2,000 gp worth).

   Typical glyphs shock for 1d4 points of electrical damage per level of the spellcaster,
explode for a like amount of fire damage, paralyze, blind, deafen, and so forth. The DM
may allow any harmful priest spell effect to be used as a glyph, provided the caster is of
sufficient level to cast the spell. Successful saving throws either reduce effects by one-
half or negate them, according to the glyph employed. Glyphs cannot be affected or
bypassed by such means as physical or magical probing, though they can be dispelled by
magic and foiled by high-level thieves using their find-and-remove-traps skill.

   The DM may decide that the exact glyphs available to a priest depend on his religion,
and he might make new glyphs available according to the magical research rules.

					<p>   By means of this spell, the caster holds one to four animals rigid. Animals affected are
normal or giant-sized mammals, birds, or reptiles, but not monsters such as centaurs,
gorgons, harpies, naga, etc. Apes, bears, crocodiles, dogs, eagles, foxes, giant beavers,
and similar animals are subject to this spell. The hold lasts for two rounds per caster
level. The caster decides how many animals can be affected, but the greater the number,
the better chance each has to successfully save against the spell. Each animal gets a
saving throw: If only one is the subject of the spell, it has a penalty of -4 on its roll; if two
are subject, each receives a penalty of -2 on its roll; if three are subject, each receives a
penalty of -1 on its roll; and if four are subject, each gets an unmodified saving throw.
   A maximum body weight of 400 pounds (100 pounds for nonmammals) per animal per

caster level can be affected--for example, an 8th-level caster can affect up to four 3,200-
pound mammals or a like number of 800-pound nonmammals, such as birds or reptiles.

					<p>   This spell helps locate a known or familiar object. The priest casts the spell, slowly
turns, and will sense when he is facing in the direction of the object to be located,
provided the object is within range--for example, 90 yards for 3rd-level priests, 100 yard
for 4th, 110 yards for 5th, etc. The spell locates such objects as apparel, jewelry,
furniture, tools, weapons, or even a ladder or stairway. Once the caster has fixed in his
mind the items sought, the spell locates only that item. Attempting to find a specific item
such as a kingdom's crown, requires an accurate mental image. If the image is not close
enough to the actual item, the spell does not work; in short, desired but unique objects
cannot be located by this spell unless they are known by the caster. The spell is blocked
by lead.

   The casting requires the use of a piece of lodestone.
   The reversal, obscure object, hides an object from location by spell, crystal ball, or
similar means for eight hours. The caster must touch the object being concealed.
   Neither application of the spell affects living creatures.

					<p>   This spell enables the priest to meld his body and possessions into a single block of
stone. The stone must be large enough to accommodate his body in all three dimensions.
When the casting is complete, the priest and not more than 100 pounds of nonliving gear
merge with the stone. If either condition is violated, the spell fails and is wasted.

   While in the stone, the priest remains in contact, however tenuous, with the face of the
stone through which he melded. The priest remains aware of the passage of time. Nothing
that goes on outside the stone can be seen or heard, however. Minor physical damage to
the stone does not harm the priest, but its partial destruction, if enough so that the caster
no longer fits, expels the priest with 4d8 points of damage. The stone's destruction expels
the priest and slays him instantly, unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell.

   The magic lasts for 1d8+8 rounds, with the variable part of the duration rolled secretly
by the DM. At any time before the duration expires, the priest can step out of the stone
through the stone surface he entered. If the duration runs out, or the effect is dispelled
before the priest exits the stone, he is violently expelled and suffers 4d8 points of
damage.

   The following spells harm the priest if cast upon the stone that he is occupying: stone
to flesh expels the priest and inflicts 4d8 points of damage; stone shape causes 4d4 points
of damage, but does not expel the priest; transmute rock to mud expels and slays him
instantly unless he rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell; and passwall expels the priest
without damage.

					<p>   This spell affords the caster or touched creature partial protection from undead
monsters with Negative Energy plane connections (such as shadows, wights, wraiths,
spectres, or vampires) and certain weapons and spells that drain energy levels. The
negative plane protection spell opens a channel to the Positive Energy plane, possibly
offsetting the effect of the negative energy attack. A protected creature struck by a
negative energy attack is allowed a saving throw vs. death magic. If successful, the
energies cancel with a bright flash of light and a thunderclap. The protected creature
suffers only normal hit point damage from the attack and does not suffer any drain of
experience or Strength, regardless of the number of levels the attack would have drained.
An attacking undead creature suffers 2d6 points of damage from the positive energy; a
draining wizard or weapon receives no damage.

   This protection is proof against only one such attack, dissipating immediately whether
or not the saving throw was successful. If the saving throw is failed, the spell recipient
suffers double the usual physical damage, in addition to the loss of experience or Strength
that normally occurs. The protection lasts for one turn per level of the priest casting the
spell, or until the protected creature is struck by a negative energy attack. This spell
cannot be cast on the Negative Energy plane.

					<p>   By means of the prayer spell, the priest brings special favor upon himself and his party
and causes harm to his enemies. Those in the area at the instant the spell is completed are
affected for the duration of the spell. When the spell is completed, all attack and damage
rolls and saving throws made by those in the area of effect who are friendly to the priest
gain +1 bonuses, while those of the priest's enemies suffer -1 penalties. Once the prayer
spell is uttered, the priest can do other things, unlike a chant, which he must continue to
make the spell effective. If another priest of the same religious persuasion (not merely the
same alignment) is chanting when a prayer is cast, the effects combine to +2 and -2, as
long as both are in effect at once.

   The priest needs a silver holy symbol, prayer beads, or a similar device as the material
component of this spell.

					<p>   The effect of a protection from fire spell differs according to whether the recipient of
the magic is the caster or some other creature. In either case, the spell lasts no longer than
one turn per caster level.

   If the spell is cast upon the caster, it confers complete invulnerability to: normal fires
(torches, bonfires, oil fires, and the like); exposure to magical fires such as fiery dragon
breath; spells such as burning hands, fireball, fire seeds, fire storm, flame strike, and
meteor swarm; hell hound or pyrohydra breath, etc. The invulnerability lasts until the
spell has absorbed 12 points of heat or fire damage per level of the caster, at which time
the spell is negated.

   If the spell is cast upon another creature, it gives invulnerability to normal fire, gives a
bonus of +4 to saving throw die rolls vs. fire attacks, and reduces damage sustained from
magical fires by 50%.

   The caster's holy symbol is the material component.

					<p>   Upon casting this spell, the priest is usually able to remove a curse on an object, on a
person, or in the form of some undesired sending or evil presence. Note that the remove
curse spell does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, for
example, although the spell typically enables the person afflicted with any such cursed
item to get rid of it. Certain special curses may not be countered by this spell, or may be
countered only by a caster of a certain level or more. A caster of 12th level or more can
cure lycanthropy with this spell by casting it on the animal form. The were-creature
receives a saving throw vs. spell and, if successful, the spell fails and the priest must gain
a level before attempting the remedy on this creature again.

   The reverse of the spell is not permanent; the bestow curse spell lasts for one turn for
every experience level of the priest using the spell. The curse can have one of the
following effects (roll percentile dice): 50% of the time it reduces one ability of the
victim to 3 (the DM randomly determines which ability); 25% of the time it lowers the
victim's attack and saving throw rolls by -4; 25% of the time it makes the victim 50%
likely to drop whatever he is holding (or do nothing, in the case of creatures not using
tools)--roll each round.

   It is possible for a priest to devise his own curse, and it should be similar in power to
those given here. Consult your DM. The subject of a bestow curse spell must be touched.
If the victim is touched, a saving throw is still applicable; if it is successful, the effect is
negated. The bestowed curse cannot be dispelled.

					<p>   By the use of this spell, the priest can free one or more creatures from the effects of
any paralyzation or from related magic (such as a ghoul touch, or a hold or slow spell). If
the spell is cast on one creature, the paralyzation is negated. If cast on two creatures, each
receives another saving throw vs. the effect that afflicts it, with a +4 bonus. If cast on
three or four creatures, each receives another saving throw with a +2 bonus. There must
be no physical or magical barrier between the caster and the creatures to be affected, or
the spell fails and is wasted.

					<p>   Upon casting a speak with dead spell, the priest is able to ask several questions of a
dead creature in a set period of time and receive answers according to the knowledge of
that creature. Of course, the priest must be able to converse in the language that the dead
creature once used. The length of time the creature has been dead is a factor, since only
higher level priests can converse with a long-dead creature. The number of questions that
can be answered and the length of time in which the questions can be asked depend on
the level of experience of the priest. Even if the casting is successful, such creatures are
as evasive as possible when questioned. The dead tend to give extremely brief and
limited answers, often cryptic, and to take questions literally. Furthermore, their
knowledge is often limited to what they knew in life.

   A dead creature of different alignment or of higher level or Hit Dice than the caster's
level receives a saving throw vs. spell. A dead creature that successfully saves can refuse
to answer questions, ending the spell. At the DM's option, the casting of this spell on a
given creature might be restricted to once per week.

   The priest needs a holy symbol and burning incense in order to cast this spell upon the
body, remains, or a portion thereof. The remains are not expended. This spell does not
function under water.

					<p>   A starshine spell enables the caster to softly illuminate an area as if it were exposed to
a clear night sky filled with stars. Regardless of the height of the open area in which the
spell is cast, the area immediately beneath it is lit by starshine. Vision ranges are the same
as those for a bright moonlit night--movement noted out to 100 yards; stationary
creatures seen up to 50 yards; general identifications made at 30 yards; and recognition at
10 yards. The spell creates shadows and has no effect on infravision. The area of effect
actually appears to be a night sky, but disbelief of the illusion merely enables the
disbeliever to note that the "stars" are actually evoked lights. This spell does not function
under water.

   The material components are several stalks from an amaryllis plant (especially
Hypoxis) and several holly berries.

					<p>   By means of this spell, the caster can form an existing piece of stone into any shape
that suits his purposes. For example, he can make a stone weapon, a special trapdoor, or a
crude idol. By the same token, it enables the spellcaster to shape a stone door, perhaps so
as to escape imprisonment, providing the volume of stone involved is within the limits of
the area of effect. While stone coffers can be thus formed, stone doors made, etc., the
fineness of detail is not great. If the shaping has moving parts, there is a 30% chance they
do not work.

   The material component of this spell is soft clay that must be worked into roughly the
desired shape of the stone object, and then touched to the stone when the spell is uttered.

					<p>   The summon insects spell attracts a cloud or swarm of normal insects to attack the foes
of the caster. Flying insects appear 70% of the time, while crawling insects appear 30%
of the time. The exact insects called are bees, biting flies, hornets, or wasps, if flying
insects are indicated; biting ants or pinching beetles, if crawling insects are indicated. A
cloud of the flying type, or a swarm of the crawling sort, appears after the spell is cast.
This gathers at a point chosen by the caster, within the spell's range, and attacks any
single creature the caster points to.

   The attacked creature sustains 2 points of damage if it does nothing but attempt to flee
or fend off the insects during the time it is attacked; it suffers 4 points of damage per
round otherwise. If the insects are ignored, the victim fights with a -2 penalty to his attac
roll and a +2 penalty to his Armor Class. If he attempts to cast a spell, an initiative roll
should be made for the insects to see if their damage occurs before the spell is cast. If it
does, the victim's concentration is ruined and the spell is lost.

   The insects disperse and the spell ends if the victim enters thick smoke or hot flames.
Besides being driven off by smoke or hot flames, the swarm might possibly be outrun, or
evaded by plunging into a sufficient body of water. If evaded, the summoned insects can
be sent against another opponent, but there will be at least a 1 round delay while they
leave the former opponent and attack the new victim. Crawling insects can travel only
about 10 feet per round (maximum speed over smooth ground) and flying insects travel
60 feet per round. The caster must concentrate to maintain the swarm; it dissipates if he
moves or is disturbed.

   It is possible, in underground situations, that the caster might summon 1d4 giant ants
by means of the spell, but the possibility is only 30% unless giant ants are nearby. This
spell does not function under water.

   The materials needed for this spell are the caster's holy symbol, a flower petal, and a
bit of mud or wet clay.

					<p>    This spell can be cast in two different ways. The first, appropriate for battlefield use,
has a range of 180 yards, a casting time of one turn, and duration of 1d4+2 turns. During
this period, the affected unit can fight in one specific type of terrain (specified by the
caster) as if it were the favored terrain (per BATTLESYSTEMTM rules) for that unit.
While this spell is in effect, the unit gains no benefit when fighting in their actual favored
terrain; the magically-enforced favored terrain takes precedence. The priest can cancel
the spell before the duration expires if desired.

    The material component is a pinch of clay dust.
    The second effect requires preparation in advance. The priest and unit must be within
100 yards of a place of worship dedicated to the casting priest's deity. The casting time is
5 turns.
    At the conclusion of the casting, the unit gains the benefit described above, with two
main differences. First, the unit does not lose the benefit of fighting in its own actual
favored terrain (the unit effectively has two favored terrains). Second, the spell endures
until the next sunset. Only priests of 12th level and higher can cast this variation.
    The material component is the priest's holy symbol.

					<p>    This spell allows a priest to plant a section of ground with magically created caltrops.
The spell can create two kinds of caltrops: infantry and cavalry. The first are of small size
and are designed to harm foot soldiers. The latter are larger and cause serious damage to
cavalry or units composed of size L or larger creatures. Cavalry caltrops are so large that
size M or smaller creatures can easily step around them. This prevents damage to infantry
units.

    Each time a unit moves into a planted area, the unit suffers an attack of AD4 (for
infantry caltrops) or AD6 (for cavalry caltrops). Units charging through a planted area
suffer double damage. If a unit ends its movement in a caltrop-sown region, it suffers
another attack when it moves out of the area.
    This spell can create a rectangular field of infantry caltrops up to 160 square yards in

area (e.g., 4 yards x 40 yards, 2 yards x 80 yards, etc.), or a field of cavalry caltrops up to
90 square yards in area (e.g., 3 yards x 30 yards, 2 yards x 45 yards, etc.).

    Ordinary caltrops make no distinction between friend or foe; all creatures entering a
caltrop-sown area suffer the same consequences. The same is true of magical caltrops,
with one exception: the casting priest can terminate the spell at any time, causing the
caltrops to vanish and leaving the terrain clear.

    Unlike normal caltrops, a region sown with magical caltrops cannot be "swept" clear;
the magical caltrops remain in place until the spell terminates.

    The material component is a golden caltrop.

					<p>    This spell can be cast in one of two ways: in a manner that affects the priest, or in a
manner that affects a subject other than the priest.

    The first method affects only the priest and allows him to shield his true emotions
from magical examination. Thus, it can block wizard spells such as ESP or priest spells
such as emotion read. While emotion control is in effect, anyone using one of these spells
will sense the emotion designated by the priest rather than his true emotions. When the
priest casts emotion control, he designates the false emotion he wishes to be revealed.

    This use of emotion control also gives the priest a +2 bonus to saving throws against
the following spells: spook, taunt, irritation, know alignment, scare, emotion, fear, and
phantasmal killer. When any of these spells are cast on the priest, he is immediately
aware of the attempt, although he does not learn the source of the spell.

    If another character casts emotion read, ESP, or a similar spell on the priest, the priest
must make a saving throw vs. spells with a +1 bonus for each 5 levels of the priest. If the
priest successfully saves, the other spellcaster reads the false emotion; if the priest fails
the saving throw, the spellcaster reads the priest's true emotion.

    The second use of this spell allows the priest to create a single emotional reaction in
the subject(s) (similar to the wizard spell emotion). Some typical emotions follow, but the
DM may allow other similar effects.

    Courage: The subject becomes berserk, gaining +1 to attack rolls and +3 to damage,
and temporarily gaining 4 hit points (damage against the subject is deducted from these
temporary points first). The subject need never check morale, and receives a +5 bonus to
saving throws against the various forms of fear. Courage counters (and is countered by)
fear.

    Fear: The subject flees from the priest for the duration of the spell, even if this takes
him out of spell range. Fear counters (and is countered by) courage.

    Friendship: The subject reacts positively to any encounter; in game terms, any result
of a roll on the Encounter Reactions table (Table 59 in the DMG ) is moved one column
to the left. Thus, a threatening PC becomes cautious, an indifferent PC becomes friendly,
etc. Friendship counters (and is countered by) hate.

    Happiness: The subject experiences feelings of warmth, well-being, and confidence,
modifying all reaction rolls by +3. The subject is unlikely to attack unless provoked.
Happiness counters (and is countered by) sadness.

    Hate: The subject reacts negatively to any encounter; in game terms, any result of a
roll on the Encounter Reactions table is moved one column to the right (i.e., a friendly PC
becomes indifferent, a cautious PC becomes threatening, etc.). Hate counters (and is
countered by) friendship.

    Hope: The subject's morale is improved by +2. His saving throw rolls, attack, and
damage rolls are all improved by +1 while this emotion is in effect. Hope counters (and is
countered by) hopelessness.

    Hopelessness: The subject's morale suffers a -10 penalty. In addition, in the round in
which the emotion is initially established, all subjects must immediately make a morale
check. Hopelessness counters (and is countered by) hope.

    Sadness: The subject feels uncontrollably glum and is prone to fits of morose
introspection. All attack rolls suffer a -1 penalty and initiative rolls suffer a +1 penalty.
The subject's chance of being surprised is increased by -2. Sadness counters (and is
countered by) happiness.
    All subjects of the second version, even willing targets, must save vs. spell to resist
the emotion. In addition to all other modifiers, the saving throw is modified by -1 for
every three levels of the priest casting the spell.
The material component for both versions of the spell is a small bunch of fleece or
uncarded wool that is consumed in the casting.

					<p>    When extradimensional detection is cast, the priest detects the existence of any
extradimensional spaces or pockets in a path 10 feet wide and 60 feet long in the
direction he is facing. The priest may turn, scanning a 60 arc each round, or may move
slowly while the spell is in effect to change the sweep of the detection.

    Extradimensional spaces include those created by spells such as rope trick and those
contained within such items as bags of holding and portable holes. The priest does not
automatically know the size of the space or its source.

    This spell detects interplanar gates and the "gate" opened by the spell
extradimensional folding.

    The spell can be blocked by a stone wall of one foot thickness or more, a one-inch
thickness of solid metal, or one yard or more of solid wood.

					<p>    All invisible creatures who enter an area enchanted with invisibility purge instantly
become visible. Invisibility -related spells do not take effect within the boundaries of the
enchanted area, and magical devices such as potions of invisibility do not function.
Creatures with the natural ability to become invisible are unable to use this ability within
the area of effect. Invisible objects carried into the warded area also become visible.

    Invisible creatures or persons within the area of effect when invisibility purge is cast
remain invisible; however, if such creatures exit the area of effect and later re-enter, they
instantly become visible. Such creatures also lose any natural ability to turn invisible as
long as they remain within the area of effect.

    A creature who consumes a potion of invisibility outside the warded area becomes
invisible normally, but becomes visible when he enters the area of effect; if the duration
of the potion of invisibility has not yet expired when he exits the area of effect, he
becomes invisible again outside the area.

    Creatures who are invisible in their natural state or have no visible form (such as
invisible stalkers) are not affected by this spell.

    The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a silver mirror no more
than three inches in diameter.

    The invisibility purge can be cast as a cooperative magic spell. The potency of this
spell can be increased if several priests cast it at the same time. The duration of the spell
is then equal to one turn per level of the most powerful priest, plus one turn for every
contributing priest. Each priest also increases the area of effect by one 10'x 10' square
(these areas must be contiguous). Thus, a 9th-level priest and two 5th-level priests could
create a 30'x 10' invisibility purge area having a duration of 11 turns.

					<p>    This cooperative spell requires at least two priests to cast the spell simultaneously.
During the casting, the priests determine whether the line will be stationary or portable.

    If the spell is stationary, each priest must inscribe a magical sigil on parallel facing
surfaces, such as facing walls of a gatehouse or two tree trunks. If the spell is portable,
the priests must stand at each end of the line, thereby anchoring it.
    After the spell is cast, a shimmering field of force appears between the two anchors
(the sigils or priests). The field is 10 feet high and sparkles with energy. Objects on the
opposite side of the translucent field, while recognizable, are hazy and indistinct.

    The field causes 1d3 points of damage to all creatures passing through it; evil
creatures and undead suffer 1d8 points of damage from the field. Creatures that roll a
successful saving throw suffer no damage. Creatures that can fly over the field, burrow
under it, or teleport to the other side are immune to damage.

    If the spell is cast in its portable form, the priests can move at half their movement
rates (limited to the rate of the slower priest). The priests can take no other action, since
all their energy is spent in walking and maintaining the field.

    Once created, the field cannot be increased or decreased in length and must remain
straight. The priests could maneuver by pivoting, but could not walk toward each other or
bend the field around a corner. If the line of sight between the two priests is blocked by
any object of greater than 5' diameter, the spell immediately fails. Thus, creatures, low
walls, young trees, pillars, and similar objects will not disrupt the spell.

    As a cooperative spell, several priests can link together to create a longer field. Each
priest (or sigil) forms the end of one field and the beginning of another, much like
fenceposts. Each section of the spell must extend in a straight line, but the field can be
bent at each junction. Four priests could form a long line, a square, or a Z pattern. The
restrictions on moving the fields apply as outlined above. The DM may apply movement
penalties depending on the complexity of the pattern.

    The material components are the priests' croziers, staves, or religious standards, held
aloft by each caster.

    The reverse of this spell, line of destruction, causes 1d3 damage to all creatures
passing through it. It causes 1d8 damage to paladins and creatures of good alignment who
pass through it. Creatures that roll a successful saving throw suffer no damage.

					<p>    Rigid thinking can be cast only upon a creature with Intelligence of 3 or greater. The
creature is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects.

    The creature affected by rigid thinking is in capable of performing any action other
than the activity he is involved in when the spell takes effect. The creature's mind simply
cannot decide on another course of action--it becomes frozen into a single thought and
cannot change even if new circumstances would suggest otherwise. Thus, a warrior
fighting a kobold will ignore the arrival of a beholder, and a thief picking a lock will pay
no heed to the arrival of three guards.

    The affected creature does not mechanically repeat the action; he is not an automaton.
He will not continue to fire his bow at a dragon if he runs out of arrows, but will choose
another means of attacking the dragon to the exclusion of all other activities.

    A spellcaster in the process of casting a spell when rigid thinking takes effect will not
attempt to repeat the spell (unless the spell has been memorized more than once). The
spellcaster will, however, devote his attention to the target of that spell until his goal is
met (e.g., if the caster were attacking a creature, he would continue to direct attacks at
that creature; if the caster were trying to open a door, he would continue to work on the
door until it opens).
    The spell expires when the creature accomplishes his goal (i.e., the kobold is killed or
the lock is opened) or when the duration of the spell has ended.

					<p>    A surface affected by squeaking floors squeaks loudly when any creature larger than
a normal rat (larger than one-half cubic foot or weighing more than three pounds) steps
on it or touches it. The spell affects a square whose sides equal the caster's level times 10
feet (a 9th-level priest could affect a square whose sides are 90 feet long).

    The squeaks can be heard in a 100-foot radius, regardless of interposing barriers such
as walls and doors. The squeaks occur regardless of the surface, whether wood, stone,
dirt, or any other solid material. Listeners automatically know the direction of the sounds.

    Characters who successfully move silently reduce the radius of the noise to 50 feet.
Those able to fly or otherwise avoid direct contact with the affected surface will not
activate the squeaking floor.

    The material component is a rusty iron hinge that squeaks when moved.

					<p>    By casting this spell on a group of lawful creatures, the priest imbues each creature
with a Strength bonus equal to that of the strongest creature in the group. To be affected
by the spell, all creatures must touch the hand of the priest at the time of casting. Only
human, demihuman, and humanoid creatures of man-size or smaller may be affected. The
characters can be a mixed group of Lawful Neutral, Lawful Good, or Lawful Evil
alignments. The spell will not take effect if any creature of Neutral or Chaotic alignment
is included in the group.

    Prior to casting, one creature is designated the keystone. There may never be more
than one keystone in a group, even if another creature has equal strength.

    Upon completion of the spell, all affected characters gain a bonus to damage equal to
the keystone's bonus to damage from Strength. Any magical bonuses belonging to the
keystone are not added; only the keystone's natural strength is conferred on the group.

    This bonus supersedes any bonus a character might normally receive. Thus, a warrior
with 16 Strength (a +1 bonus to damage) who benefits from this spell with a keystone
who has Strength 18/07 (a damage bonus of +3) gains a total bonus of +3 to damage (not
+4 to damage). The keystone receives no bonus.

    Affected creatures gain no improvements to THAC0, bend bars/lift gates, or other
functions of Strength.

    The spell ends if the keystone is killed before the duration expires. The bonus and
duration are not affected if a member of the group is killed within the duration of the
spell.

					<p>    This cooperative spell requires at least three priests casting the spell simultaneously.
At the time of casting, the priests must be within 10 feet of each other. Upon completion
of the spell, the priests sing a single, dissonant chord. The result of the spell depends on
the number of voices in the choir.

    Trio. In this form, the spell projects a cone of sonic force 120 feet long and 40 feet
wide at the base. All creatures within the area of effect must save vs. spells or suffer 2d4
points of damage. Those who successfully save suffer only 1d4 points. Undead suffer a -2
penalty to their saving throws.

    Quartet. With four voices, the spell has the same area of effect as described above.
However, all those who fail their saving throw suffer 2d4 points of damage and are
deafened for one round. Those who successfully save suffer half damage and are not
deafened. Undead creatures are not allowed a saving throw.

    Quintet. Five singers produce a chord of major power. All within the area of effect
suffer 3d4 points of damage (saving throw for half damage). Undead are not allowed a
saving throw. All creatures are deafened for one round. Furthermore, pottery, glassware,
crystal, and similar breakable goods must save vs. fall or be shattered.

    Ensemble. An ensemble of singers consists of six to ten priests. In this case, the area
of effect increases to a cone 180 feet long and 60 feet wide at the base. All creatures
within this area suffer 1d4 points of damage per priest and are deafened for 1d4 rounds.
A successful saving throw vs. spell reduces the damage and duration of deafness by half.
Undead creatures of 3 hit dice or less are immediately destroyed. All other undead suffer
normal damage, but are not allowed a saving throw. Glass, pottery, crystal, bone, and all
wooden items that are the strength of a door or less (chests, tables, chairs, etc.) must save
vs. crushing blow or be shattered.

    Choir. The most powerful group, a choir, requires eleven or more priests. In this
case, the area of effect expands to a cone 300 feet long and 100 feet wide at the base. All
within the area of effect suffer 1d6 points of damage per priest to a maximum of 20d6. A
saving throw vs. spells reduces the damage to half. Those who fail to save are deafened
for 1d10 rounds; those who succeed are deafened only 1d6 rounds. Undead creatures of 5
hit dice or less are immediately destroyed. Undead with more hit dice are not allowed a
saving throw. Structures within the area of effect are damaged as if they suffered a direct
hit from a catapult (one hit per four priests in the choir). Doors, chests, and other
breakable items are instantly shattered.

					<p>    Zone of sweet air creates an invisible barrier around the area of effect that repels all
noxious elements from poisonous vapors, including those created magically (such as a
stinking cloud). The spell offers no protection against poisonous vapors created by a
dragon's breath weapon (such as the chlorine gas of a green dragon). Noxious gases
already within the area of effect when the spell is cast are not affected. Fresh air passes
into the area normally.

    If a poisonous vapor is expelled within the area of effect (for example, a stinking
cloud is cast), the spell takes effect normally but dissipates in half the time normally
required.

					<p>         When a priest casts this spell, he forces an animal to do his bidding. The creature
is entitled to a saving throw vs. spell; if it fails, the caster may direct the creature with
simple commands to act in any fashion desired. Sample commands include attack, run,
fetch, etc. Suicidal or self-destructive commands grant the subject another saving throw
to break free of the caster's control, with a +1 to +4 bonus depending on the extremity of
the caster's orders. Ordering an animal to engage in combat is not necessarily
self-destructive, as long as the prospective opponent is not more than three times the
animal's Hit Dice or more than two size categories larger than the subject. For example, a
wolf (3 Hit Dice, size M) would attack a troll (6+6 Hit Dice, size L) without hesitation,
but it might break free of the caster's control if ordered to attack a size H dragon or an
8+8 HD umber hulk.

         Control animal establishes a mental link between the caster and the subject, and
the animal can be directed by silent mental command as long as it remains within range.
Because the caster's intelligence directs the animal, the creature may be able to take
actions normally beyond its own comprehension, such as manipulating objects with its
paws and mouth. The caster need not concentrate in order to maintain control of the
creature unless he is trying to direct it to do something it normally couldn't.

         Control animal only works on normal or giant-sized animals with Intelligence
ratings between 1 and 4. Magical animals, monsters, and creatures of low Intelligence or
higher are immune to the effects of this spell. Druids always avoid using this spell.

					<p>         This divination reveals the presence of disembodied or noncorporeal spirits of all
types, including wraiths, ghosts, spectres, astrally-projecting creatures, characters or
monsters employing magic jar or possession, and (of course) animal spirits and spirits of
nature. Characters or monsters who are simply invisible, phased, or ethereal do not count
as spirits, since they are physically present in the flesh despite their unusual status. The
caster detects spirits in a path 10 feet wide and 60 feet long; any within the area of effect
are revealed in their preferred form or appearance for all to see. Simply detecting a spirit
doesn't give the caster any special ability to communicate with or attack the entity.

least 20 gp.

					<p>         Originally developed by the Harmonium faction of the Outer Planes, this useful
spell has come into more widespread use in recent years. While the spell is available as a
2nd-level enchantment for members of the Harmonium, the general version is not quite as
efficient and is considered a 3rd-level spell.

         The dictate spell is an improved version of command, affecting up to 6 creatures
in a 20-foot cube. The caster is not limited to a single word and can issue an order of no
more than a dozen words in length. All the specified targets who fail their saving throws
must attempt to obey the caster's instructions. For example, a priest could issue a dictate
such as "Stay here until I return," "Throw down your weapons," or "Seize that elf!" The
subjects will continue to obey nonimmediate orders for up to one round per experience
level of the caster.

         Subjects who cannot understand the caster are not affected, so characters who do
not understand the caster's language are immune to this spell. In addition, the order must
create an immediate and obvious course of action for the subject; a dictate to "Die!" or
"Feel sorry for him!" would simply cause the subject to stand still in confusion for one
round. Poorly worded or confusing commands grant the subjects a +1 to +4 bonus on
their saving throws at the DM's discretion. Similarly, if after the subject fails his saving
throw he is given an obviously self-destructive dictate, the subject simply loses his next
round as he fights off the compulsion.

					<p>         By means of this spell, the priest prepares an area as a defensive position. Fortify
may be used to prepare an open outdoors area such as a field, road, or grassland, or a
rough or broken outdoors area such as a hillside, forest, or boulder-fall. Large rooms or
chambers such as a cavern or a great hall may be fortified as well. The exact effects of the
spell depend on the nature of the site to be fortified.

         A. Open Outdoors Site: A rampart or dike of earth and loose stone rises from the
ground along the perimeter of the site, leaving a shallow ditch on the outward face.
Creatures defending the dike receive 50% cover against missile fire (+4 bonus to AC), or
25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing
missiles out of the dike. Attackers cannot charge, run, or sprint over the ditch-and-dike.
Large, open rooms or chambers with few features may fall into this category.

         B. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones and boulders, deadwood, and patches of
dense briars are arranged to form a defensible wall or rampart along the perimeter of the
area of effect. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 75% cover (+7 bonus to AC), or
50% cover if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the wall. In
hand-to-hand combat, the wall's defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls; man-sized
attackers must spend one full round in climbing over the wall in order to enter the
fortified area. Natural caverns and large, cluttered chambers fall into this category, as
well.

         C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In areas such as swamp, marsh, bog, or tundra,
fortify cannot raise a wall or dike to cover the defenders. Instead, the spell creates a
water-filled ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 10 feet wide and
2 to 4 feet deep; most creatures require 1 full round to negotiate the ditch, and defenders
gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the ditch or climbing up
the other side.
         The fortifications are permanent, although erosion, weathering, and excavations,
clearing, or filling can quickly raze the site, returning it to its original state. The material
component is the shell of a snail dusted with 100 gold pieces worth of diamond powder.
In Battlesystem® rules, fortify provides a defending unit with a +2 bonus to its AR
against missile and melee attacks, but no bonus against missile attacks in marshy or
low-lying areas.

					<p>         This spell summons a minor spirit or entity to the caster's aid. Clerics usually
summon minor elementals of some kind, while shamans typically conjure an animal spirit
or spirit of nature. Regardless of the spirit's origin, it appears as a ghostly beast of some
kind--wolves, bears, tigers, or lions are most common. The animal spirit obeys the
mental commands of the priest, attacking his enemies or performing any other task that it
could reasonably accomplish. The creature is incorporeal and cannot handle or
manipulate objects of any kind, but it can see and hear as a normal animal of its archetype
and could be used to scout a dangerous area or act as a distraction of some kind.

         In combat, the animal spirit has the following statistics: MV 24; AC 4; THAC0
15; Dmg 2d4. It can only be injured by magical weapons and can strike monsters hit only
by +1 or better weapons. The spirit has a number of hit points equal to 10 plus the
caster's level, so a 6th-level priest conjures a animal spirit with 16 hit points. The
creature is not affected by charm, sleep, hold, or other mind-affecting spells and suffers
no damage from cold-based attacks. However, it is vulnerable to dispel magic or turning
as an undead monster of the caster's Hit Dice. If the animal spirit is turned, destroyed, or
dispelled, the priest who summoned it must make a saving throw vs. spell or be stunned
for 1d4 rounds.

         Because the spirit is intelligent and free-willed under the caster's direction, the
priest need not concentrate in order to direct its attacks--an animal spirit could be
ordered to attack a spellcaster in the back of an enemy party, while the cleric waded into
hand-to-hand combat. The animal spirit makes use of flank or rear attacks when it can
and gains any normal combat bonuses that a living creature in its position would be
entitled to. The priest enjoys instantaneous, silent communication with the animal spirit
and can order it to stop attacking, to change its target, or to undertake almost any
conceivable action desired. However, the spirit must remain within the spell's range; if it
is ever more than 10 yards per caster level away from the priest, it dissipates harmlessly.

         The material component is a small whistle carved from a bone taken from the
appropriate type of animal.

				<div id="description-content">
					<p>         This spell is an improved version of slow poison, with a duration measured in
days rather than hours. When cast upon a victim who has been poisoned by any means,
hold poison arrests the venom and prevents it from doing any additional damage to the
victim. (In most cases, the spell must be cast during the poison's onset time in order to be
effective.) Damage that has already been inflicted is not restored, but as long as the hold
poison is in effect, the victim can be cured or healed of damage caused by poison by any
normal means.

         This spell can be used to indefinitely postpone the onset of a poison if the caster
chooses to continue to cast it on the poisoned character before the previous hold poison
wears off. However, each time a new hold poison is used to stop the venom's advance for
another few days, there is a 2% cumulative chance that the spell fails and the poison runs
its course. Evil priests have been known to deliberately poison a person and then use this
spell to grant the victim a stay of death for a few days. This can be an extremely effective
threat if the victim doesn't have access to a neutralize poison spell.

         The material component is the priest's holy symbol and a bud of garlic, crushed
and smeared on the injury (or eaten if the poison was ingested).

					<p>         Repair injury is intended for use in campaigns featuring the critical hit or critical
strike rules. This spell addresses one specific injury or wound (see Chapter 8). It can be
used to knit a broken bone, alleviate the swelling and pain of a sprain or a twist, or repair
soft-tissue damage such as an injured eye, ear, or a severed tendon. If used as a simple
curing spell, repair injury restores 1d10+1 hit points to the injured character, but if used
to address the effects of a specific injury, repair injury automatically removes one
grazed, struck, injured, or broken condition, and alleviates any combat, movement, or
maximum hit point penalties associated with the injury in question. The spell does not
restore any lost hit points to the victim, other than the 1d10+1 that are incidental to the
working of the spell.

         Beran, a fighter with 44 hit points, is struck by an ogre's club. The blow inflicts
12 points of damage, but Beran also suffers a broken hip. This injury will reduce him to a
maximum of 25% of his normal total, so Beran's current hit points drop from 32 to 11
after the battle ends. In addition, he is not capable of moving or attacking due to the
effects of the injury.

         When the smoke clears, Talmos the priest comes to Beran's aid. Using repair
injury, he knits Beran's broken hip. The spell cures 6 hit points in the process. Beran no
longer suffers the movement or attack penalties for a broken hip and has 17 hit points to
his credit. With time or additional healing, he can regain his normal total of 44.

         Repair injury is also helpful in dealing with wounds that fall in the crushed,
shattered, or destroyed category. This spell reduces the severity of the injury to the
broken level, which means it heals as if it were 20d6 lost hit points. Only one repair
injury can be used on any given wound, so a character with a shattered knee could still
require a lot of time to recover after an application of this spell.

         Severed limbs, destroyed eyes or ears, and ability score losses caused by injuries
cannot be healed by this spell. Repair injury is the equivalent of cure serious wounds for
the purpose of slowing or stopping bleeding.

					<p>   A priest who casts this spell is immediately able to determine if the subject creature
deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie. It does not reveal the truth, uncover
unintentional inaccuracies, or necessarily reveal evasions. The subject receives a saving
throw vs. spell, which is adjusted only by the Wisdom of the caster--for example, if the
caster has a Wisdom of 18, the subject's saving throw roll is reduced by 4 (see Table 5:
Wisdom).

   The material component for the detect lie spell is one gp worth of gold dust.

      The spell's reverse, undetectable lie, prevents the magical detection of lies spoken by
the creature for 24 hours.

					<p>   A divination spell is used to garner a useful piece of advice concerning a specific goal,
event, or activity that will occur within a one-week period. This can be as simple as a
short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. Unlike the augury
spell, this gives a specific piece of advice.

   For example, if the question is "Will we do well if we venture to the third level?" and a
terrible troll guarding 10,000 gp and a shield +1 lurks near the entrance to the level (the
DM estimates the party could beat the troll after a hard fight), the divination response
might be: "Ready oil and open flame light your way to wealth." In all cases, the DM
controls what information is received and whether additional divinations will supply
additional information. Note that if the information is not acted upon, the conditions
probably change so that the information is no longer useful (in the example, the troll
might move away and take the treasure with it).

   The base chance for a correct divination is 60%, plus 1% for each experience level of
the priest casting the spell. The DM makes adjustments to this base chance considering
the actions being divined (if, for example, unusual precautions against the spell have been
taken). If the dice roll is failed, the caster knows the spell failed, unless specific magic
yielding false information is at work.

   The material components of the divination spell are a sacrificial offering, incense, and
the holy symbol of the priest. If an unusually important divination is attempted, sacrifice
of particularly valuable gems, jewelry, or magical items may be required.

					<p>   By means of a neutralize poison spell, the priest detoxifies any sort of venom in the
creature or substance touched. Note that an opponent, such as a poisonous reptile or
snake (or even an envenomed weapon of an opponent) unwilling to be so touched
requires the priest to roll a successful attack in combat. This spell can prevent death in a
poisoned creature if cast before death occurs. The effects of the spell are permanent only
with respect to poison existing in the touched creature at the time of the touch; thus,
creatures (and objects) that generate new poison are not permanently detoxified.

   The reversed spell, poison, likewise requires a successful attack roll, and the victim is
allowed a saving throw vs. poison. If the latter is unsuccessful, the victim is incapacitated
and dies in one turn unless the poison is magically neutralized or slowed.

					<p>   The globe of protection of this spell is identical in all respects to that of a protection
from evil spell, except that it encompasses a much larger area and its duration is greater.
The effect is centered on and moves with the creature touched. Any protected creature
within the circle will break the warding against enchanted/summoned monsters if he
attacks those monsters. A creature unable to fit completely into the area of effect (for
example, a 21-foot-tall titan) remains partially exposed and subject to whatever penalties
the DM decides. If such a creature is the recipient of the spell, the spell acts as a normal
protection from evil spell for that creature only.

   The reverse, protection from good, 10' radius, wards against good creatures.
   To complete this spell, the priest must trace a circle 20 feet in diameter using holy (or
unholy) water and incense (or smoldering dung), according to the protection from evil
spell.

					<p>   The effect of a protection from lightning spell changes depending on who is the
recipient of the magic--the caster or some other creature. In either case, the spell lasts no
longer than one turn per caster level.

   If the spell is cast upon the caster, it confers complete invulnerability to electrical
attack such as dragon breath, or magical lightning such as lightning bolt, shocking grasp,
storm giant, will 'o wisp, etc., until the spell has absorbed 10 points of electrical damage
per level of the caster, at which time the spell is negated.

   If the spell is cast upon another creature, it gives a bonus of +4 to the die roll for saving
throws made vs. electrical attacks, and it reduces the damage sustained from such attacks
by 50%.

					<p>   This spell enables the caster to cause a pool of normal water found in a natural setting
to act as a scrying device. The pool can be of no greater diameter than 2 feet per level of
the caster. The effect is to create a scrying device similar to a crystal ball. The scrying
can extend only to the Ethereal Plane and the Inner Planes (which includes the
paraelemental planes, the Demiplane of Shadow, etc.). General notes on scrying,
detection by the subject, and penalties for attempting to scry beyond the caster's own
plane are given in the DMG, as well as a description of the crystal ball item.

   The following spells can be cast through a reflecting pool, with a 5% per level chance
for operating correctly: detect magic, detect snares and pits, and detect poison. Each
additional detection attempt requires a round of concentration, regardless of success.
Infravision, if available, operates normally through the reflecting pool.

   The image is nearly always hazy enough to prevent the reading of script of any type.
   The material component is the oil extracted from such nuts as the hickory and the
walnut, refined, and dropped in three measures upon the surface of the pool. (A measure
need be no more than a single ounce of oil.)
   At the DM's option, the casting of this spell may be limited to once per day.

					<p>   When this spell is cast, the priest creates an invisible barrier to all sorts of insects, and
normal insects do not approach within 10 feet of the caster while the spell is in effect.
Giant insects with Hit Dice less than 1/3 of the caster's experience level are also repelled
(for example, 2 Hit Dice for 7th- to 9th-level casters, 3 Hit Dice at 10th through 12th
level, etc.). Insects with more Hit Dice can enter the protected area if the insect is
especially aggressive and, in addition, rolls a successful saving throw vs. spell. Those that
do sustain 1d6 points of damage from passing through the magical barrier. Note that the
spell does not in any way affect arachnids, myriapods, and similar creatures--it affects
only true insects.

					<p>   By means of this spell, the priest renders a creature touched immune to the effects of a
specified spell of 4th level or lower. It protects against spells, spell-like effects of magical
items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against breath
weapons or gaze attacks of any type.

   The spell has several additional limitations. First, the caster must have directly
experienced the effect of the specified spell. For example, if the caster has been attacked
by a fireball spell at some time, he can use the spell immunity spell to provide protection
from a fireball. Second, the spell cannot affect a creature already magically protected by a

protected against, not a certain sphere of spells or a group of spells that are similar in
effect; thus, a creature given immunity to the lightning bolt spell is still vulnerable to a
shocking grasp spell.

protected against.

					<p>    The victim of compulsive order is compelled to place everything he encounters into
perfect order. If he discovers treasure, he divides it into tidy piles or containers of silver,
gold, and copper. He is reluctant to enter a dungeon because it is a messy place, but once
inside, he is obsessed with cleaning it. A character under the power of this spell will
sweep dirt from dungeon corridors into neat piles, arrange the corpses of a defeated orc
band according to size, dash forward to remove a bit of lint on clothing, and insist that the
party organize themselves alphabetically, then by size, and then by age. While the spell
does not affect a character's abilities, the overwhelming desire for order impairs the
character's usefulness in most adventures.

    When a character afflicted by this spell attempts to undertake a new event (begin a
battle, haggle with the merchant, etc.), the player must rationalize the action on the basis
of his compulsion for order. Thus, the character cannot simply attack a goblin; he must
announce a condition such as attacking the tallest goblin and fighting his way down
according to size. Once stated, the character must follow through with this plan.

    If the player cannot conceive a rationale for his character's behavior, the character is
forced to delay his actions for 1d6 rounds, with the time spent in preparation for the
subsequent action. The character spends time arranging spell components artistically,
deciding how to hold his sword, cleaning his weapon, etc.

    Anyone affected by compulsive order may become violent if he is prevented from
being neat. He will do what he must to make the world around him more orderly. If he is
allowed to organize his surroundings, he will quickly calm down again. The victim will
constantly petition the people around him to be neat and organized.

    The victim is allowed a saving throw to avoid the effects of the spell. Compulsive
order can be removed with a dispel magic spell.

    The material component is a perfect cube made of metal.

					<p>    This spell must be cast on at least two creatures. The priest may affect one creature
per two levels of his experience, and all creatures to be affected must be within three feet
of each other at the time of casting. After the spell is completed, affected characters may
move about freely.

    Defensive harmony grants affected creatures a defensive bonus by bestowing an
enhanced coordination of their attacks and defenses. The affected creatures must be
involved in a single battle so that their efforts harmonize to the benefit of all involved.
For example, the affected creatures can attack one dragon or a group of orcs in a single
area. They can also attack additional enemy forces that arrive in the same combat. If the 
enemy forces divide and flee, the affected creatures can follow, continue to attack, and
benefit from the spell. If the affected group is split into two smaller groups when
attacked, however, it gains no benefit from defensive harmony.

    While the spell is in effect, each affected creature gains a +1 bonus to armor class for
every other creature benefitting from the spell, to a maximum bonus of +5 (although
more than five characters may be affected by the spell). Thus, if four creatures are
affected by defensive harmony, each creature gains a +3 bonus to armor class.

    This bonus represents a mystical coordination of effort on the part of all affected
creatures. A fighter will naturally wage his attack to distract the troll attacking the thief.
The ranger will instinctively block the swing of an orc, thereby protecting the wizard.
Creatures affected by the spell are not consciously aware of these efforts, and they are
unable to create specific strategies and tactics.

					<p>    An area enchanted with fire purge is protected against all types of normal and
magical fires. Normal fires (including camp fires, torches, and oil fires) cannot burn in
the area of effect. Magical fires (including fiery dragon breath, other creature-generated
fires, and spell-related fires such as burning hands and fireball) cause only 50% of their
normal damage. Additionally, creatures within the area of effect receive a +4 bonus to
saving throws made vs. fire attacks, regardless of whether the attacks originate inside or
outside the warded area.

    Fire purge has no effect on fires that are within the area of effect when the spell is
cast, (i.e., it does not extinguish existing fires).
    The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a scorched sliver of wood.
    Fire purge can be cast as cooperative magic. If a number of priests cast this spell

simultaneously, its effectiveness is significantly increased. The duration of the spell is
then equal to 1 turn per level of the most powerful priest plus 1 turn for every other
contributing priest. The area of effect is a square whose sides equal the number of priests
times 10 yards (thus, six priests could create a 60-yard by 60-yard square of protection).

					<p>    This spell creates the necessary conditions for devotional energy to be used. For faith
magic to work, the priest must create a focus to harness the necessary devotional energy.
This spell creates that focus. A focus cannot function without a source of devotional
energy.

    The focus gathers devotional energy and reshapes it in order to amplify other spells
cast by the priest (or priests). The same energy keeps the focus in existence. If the spell is
cast and there is no immediate source of devotional energy within 100 feet, the focus
immediately fails.

    Once created, most foci cannot be moved. This condition and the need for a constant
supply of devotional energy tends to limit the use of foci to temples, churches,
monasteries, shrines, and seminaries--permanent structures where followers of the
religion gather on a regular basis. Sometimes a focus is created for a special gathering
such as a holy day, conclave, grand wedding, or yearly festival.

    Not all foci are identical. The particular form of the focus depends on the power and
nature of the spell being amplified. All foci can be seen by detect magic. There are three
basic types of foci: site, item, and living.

    Site foci are connected to a place, whether a room, building, field, or forest. Once
cast, the foci cannot be moved. It causes no disturbance in the surroundings; it is invisible
and intangible.

    Item foci are centered on a single object. Customarily, this object is large and
immovable, such as an altar, but it is possible for the focus to be as small as is practical.
The item can be as elaborate or plain as desired, but should have some significance to the
religion.

    Living foci are the rarest of all types. In this case, the focus is created on a living
plant, animal, or person. Detect charm reveals the person is somehow enchanted,
although not under the influence of a typical charm spell.

    The type of focus created (site, item, or living) depends on the religion and nature of
the spell amplified. These choices are listed in Table 3: Focused Spell Effects.

    Casting the focus spell is a long and complicated process, accompanied by many
ceremonies and rituals. During the day spent casting the spell, the priest will need the
assistance of at least two other priests of the same faith. These aides need not memorize
the spell (or even be capable of casting it). Their duty is to provide the extra hands and
voices needed at specific points of the casting. A large number of worshipers must also
be present since the focus requires their energy. Not surprisingly, the casting of this spell
is often incorporated into important holy festivals or special occasions.

    The duration of the focus is one year. If the devotional energy falls below a minimum
level, the spell ends sooner. A focus requires the devotional energy of at least 100 devout
worshipers. Lay monks (those dedicated to the religion but not priests) count as two
worshipers, while priests (of any level) count as ten. A focus could be maintained by a
congregation of 100, a monastery of fifty, or a seminary of as few as 10 priests (or any
combination of the above). The focus must receive this energy for at least 10 hours out of
every day. If these conditions are not met, the focus weakens. The area of effect of the
amplified spell decreases by 20% each day until it fades away completely.

    Once the focus is created, the priest or priests have 1 turn in which to cast the desired
spell upon the focus. A focus can amplify only one spell, and each item, creature, or place
can receive only one focus. Spells that can be cast upon a focus are listed on Table 3.

    * The caster must state a desired range (temperature, wind strength, etc.) within the
spell's normal limitations at the time it is cast.

    Once the spell is cast, the normal duration and area of effect for that spell are ignored.
The focus begins to increase these factors of the spell's power. After one day, the
amplified spell reaches its full area of effect. Thereafter, it remains over that area until the
focus fails.

    The area affected by the focus (and its amplified spell) depends on the level of the
caster. The spell expands in a radius from the focus, 20 feet per level of the caster,
although it can deliberately be created smaller. Within that area of effect, the amplified
spell exerts its normal effect. A 13th-level priest could create a focus up to 260 feet in
diameter.

    The material components are many, including special vestments, incense, oils, waters,
and other equipment the DM deems appropriate. The cost of these materials is never less
than 1,000 gp plus 100 gp per level of spell being amplified. These items are given up as
offerings to the deity (perhaps to be distributed to the poor), and new ones must be
obtained each time the spell is cast.

					<p>    This is a simple cooperative magic spell. Only one priest can cast the spell, but like
mystic transfer, another priest is required for the spell to have any effect. Through this
spell, the priest improves the quality of another priest's healing spells.

    For the fortify spell to work, it must be cast simultaneously with a cure light wounds,
cure serious wounds, or cure critical wounds. The priest casting fortify must lay his hand
on the priest attempting the cure. When both spells are cast, additional energy flows
through the second priest and into the creature being healed. Fortify automatically causes
the cure spell to function at maximum effect. Thus, a cure serious wounds would
automatically heal 17 points of damage and a cure critical wounds would heal 27 points
of damage.

    The material component is the priest's holy symbol.

					<p>    This spell can be cast in one of two variations. The first, appropriate for battlefield
use, has a range of 240 yards, duration of 1d4+6 turns, and a casting time of 1 turn. The
priest can cast the spell on any single individual (a commander or hero) within his line of
sight.

    While under the influence of this spell, the subject's command radius is increased by
50% (round fractions up).

    The reverse of this variation, doubt, requires the target to make a saving throw vs.
spell. If failed, doubt halves the command radius (round fractions down) of the targeted
individual for 1d3+4 turns.

    The material component for this variation is a pinch of steel dust.
    The second variation must take place in or within 100' of a place of worship officially
dedicated to the casting priest's deity. Both the priest and the individual to be affected
must be present. The casting time is 5 turns and involves an intricate ritual and many
prayers. At the conclusion of the spell, the subject's command radius is doubled. This
effect lasts 2d12 hours.
    The priest can cast either aspect (but not both at once) on himself. No individual can
be the subject of more than one casting of this spell at one time, whether different aspects
or cast by different priests. If more than one spell is attempted on the individual, only the
most recent casting takes effect.
    The material component for the second variation is the priest's holy symbol.

					<p>    This spell temporarily doubles the movement cost of one region of ground. Units
allied to the priest are unaffected and movement is made at normal cost; only enemy units
suffer the penalty.

    A variety of effects result from the spell depending on the terrain: grass twists
hinderingly around troops' ankles, swamp becomes more viscous, rocks and gravel shift
underfoot, etc.
The spell affects only units--that is, groups of soldiers moving in regular or irregular
formation. The spell does not affect individuals or monsters moving and operating alone.
(When using the BATTLESYSTEMTM rules, figures that represent individual heroes are
not affected by this spell.)

    When casting this spell, the priest must have an uninterrupted line of sight to the
terrain to be affected. The priest can choose the shape of the area, up to the maximum
area of effect. This spell can create only one continuous area of tanglefoot. There is no
way of detecting that a particular area is under the influence of this spell simply by
looking at the area. Detect magic will reveal that the area is magically affected.
    The reverse of this spell, selective passage, cuts the movement cost of an area in half

(round fractions up) for friendly units. Again, individual heroes and creatures are not
affected by this spell (which means that advancing troops must be careful not to leave
their leader behind!).

    The material component is a drop of molasses for tanglefoot, and a pinch of
powdered graphite for selective passage.

					<p>    Uplift bestows increased spellcasting ability on one priest, including additional spells
per level and use of spells beyond the caster's normal level. This cooperative spell
requires two priests who must spend the day casting this spell. During the casting, the
priests must decide which additional spells (of all levels) are desired. Upon completion of
the casting, the priests touch palms, and the priest of higher level receives a charge of
magical energy. This charge temporarily boosts the level of the priest for spellcasting
purposes. The amount of increase is one level per five levels of the lower level caster
(fractions rounded up). If both priests are of equal level, the casters must decide who
benefits from the spell.

    The spell grants the priest the spellcasting ability of the new level. It does not
improve hit points, attack rolls, or other abilities. If the increase allows more spells per
level, the additional spells are instantly placed in the character's memory. A priest is also
enabled to cast spells normally beyond his level. Range, duration, area of effect, and
other variables are all based on the character's temporary level.

    The increased effect lasts only 1 turn. At the end of the turn, all additional spells are
lost and the character reverts to his normal level.

    As an example, consider a party with a fallen comrade. The two priests in the party
are 7th and 8th level, both unable to cast raise dead. After a night's rest, each priest adds
uplift to his memorized spells. After casting the spell, the 8th-level priest suddenly gains
the casting abilities of a 10th-level priest, including the ability to cast raise dead. At the
end of one turn, the priest's abilities revert to 8th-level.

    Casting this spell is an arduous task, causing a severe drain on the priests. When the
spell expires, the uplifted character suffers 2d6 points of damage from mental exhaustion.
This damage cannot be healed by any means until the character has had at least eight
hours of rest.

    The material components are the priests' holy symbols and an offering worth at least
500 gp from each priest.

					<p>    Weather stasis maintains the weather conditions prevalent in the area of effect when
the spell is cast. The spell affects a cube whose sides equal the caster's level times 10 feet
(a 10th-level caster could affect a 100' x 100' x 100' cube).

    An area protected by weather stasis is unaffected by temperature variations in the
surrounding environment. The spell also acts as a shield against rain, snow, and hail,
which cannot enter the protected area. If conditions of precipitation existed in the area of
effect when the spell was cast, the identical weather will continue for the duration of the
spell.

    For example, weather stasis is cast in an area where the temperature is 75 F. and no
precipitation is falling. Half an hour later, the temperature drops to 60 degrees and rain
begins to fall. The protected area remains dry and the temperature stays at 75 degrees. If
the spell had been cast while rain was falling in the area of effect, rain would continue to
fall for the duration of the spell, even after it stopped raining in the surrounding area.

    All physical objects other than rain, snow, and hail can pass into the protected area.
All creatures and characters can move freely into and out of the area. The spell does not
prevent water-based spells or water-based creatures (such as water elementals) from
operating in the area.

    The spell protects against both natural and magically generated weather. Night and
day pass normally in the protected area, although temperature variations associated with
night and day do not occur.
The material components are the priest's holy symbol and a drop of rain.

					<p>When a priest casts this spell, a green ray springs from his outstretched hand and
					unerringly strikes a creature within line of sight and the range of the spell, covering the
subject with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks bodily extradimensional
travel. Forms of movement barred by the dimensional anchor include blinking, dimension
door, etherealness, gate, phasing, plane shift, maze, shadow walk, teleportation, and
similar spell-like or psionic abilities. The field persists for one turn plus one round per
caster level and has no effect other than blocking extradimensional travel. The
dimensional anchor does not interfere with the movement of creatures in astral form, nor
does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms such as a basilisk's gaze.

					<p>         An improved version of the fortify spell, entrench has much the same effect, but
prepares an even more formidable set of defenses. Like fortify, entrench may be used to
prepare an open outdoors area such as a field or grassland, or a rough outdoors area such
as a hillside or forest. Large rooms or chambers may be entrenched as well. In addition to
the ditches and ramparts of the fortify spell, entrench makes use of local materials to
create a small palisade and an array of stakes or sharp stones to discourage attackers.

         A. Open Outdoors Site: A rampart or dike of earth faced by a staked ditch rises
from the ground along the perimeter of the site. Creatures defending the dike receive 75%
cover against missile fire (+7 bonus to AC), or 25% cover (+2 bonus) if they expose
themselves by engaging in melee combat or firing missiles out of the dike. Attackers
cannot charge, run, or sprint over the rampart, and must spend one full round negotiating
the defenses in order to attack. The dike's defenders receive a +1 bonus to attack rolls
against any creatures trying to move through the stakes or stones.

         B. Rough Outdoors Site: Loose stones, deadwood, and briars are arranged to
form a defensible wall along the perimeter of the area of effect, faced by an array of sharp
stakes or stones. Characters hiding behind the wall receive 90% cover (+10 bonus to AC),
or 50% cover (+4 bonus) if they expose themselves by firing missiles or defending the
wall. Attacking creatures cannot run, charge, or sprint through the defenses, and must
spend one full round to get through the stakes plus an additional round climbing over the
wall in order to enter the fortified area. The wall's defenders gain a +1 bonus to attacks
against creatures negotiating the defenses.

         C. Marshy or Low-lying Site: In swamps or bogs, entrench creates a water-filled
ditch around the perimeter of the area of effect. This ditch is 15 feet wide and 3 to 6 feet
deep; most creatures require two full rounds to negotiate the ditch and climb up the far
side, and defenders gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls against enemies who are wading the
ditch or climbing up the other side.

         The fortifications created by this spell are permanent, although erosion,
weathering, and clearing or filling can return the site to its original state. The material
component is the shell of a giant nautilus. In the Battlesystem rules, entrench provides the
defending units with a +3 bonus to their AR versus missile and melee attacks, but only a
+1 bonus against missile attacks in marshy areas.

					<p>         This divination enhances the caster's vision by allowing him to see through any
normal or magical darkness, fog, or mist to a range of 60 feet. In addition, the caster has a
chance of piercing magical illusions, blending, and invisibility equal to 70% plus 1% per
level of experience, less 2% per spell level. For example, a 7th-level priest has a 70% +
7% - 4%, or 73% chance, to spot a wizard concealing himself by using the 2nd-level spell
invisibility.

         Unlike the 5th-level spell true seeing, the omniscient eye does not grant the caster
the ability to perceive secret doors, traps, lost or misplaced objects, or creature
alignments; it simply ensures that the caster can see the surroundings as they would
appear without the interference of weather, lighting, or illusionary magic. Thus, the
omniscient eye can be deceived by careful camouflage, concealment, or other purely
physical precautions. Other phenomena that may bypass this spell's power include
psionic invisibility, true transparency, or extradimensional objects or creatures.

         The material component of this spell is a special ointment for the eyes that is
composed of rare powders and herbs. The ointment costs at least 100 gold pieces for a
single application.

Allies of the priest gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, or a +3 bonus if
